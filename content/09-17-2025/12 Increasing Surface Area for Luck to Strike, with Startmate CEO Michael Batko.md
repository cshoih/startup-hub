## Title: Increasing Surface Area for Luck to Strike, with Startmate CEO Michael Batko

### Session context

- Format: Interactive talk + live Q&A; screenshare with demos (LinkedIn, email intros)
- Host/Speaker: Michael Batko (CEO, Startmate; ex-Expert360, Mad Paws; Austrian/Polish background; 11 years in AU)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/batkomichael/
- Audience: Founders in Startmate universe (accelerator, Launch Club, First Believers)
- Goal: Grow and leverage your network to create serendipity; get in the best rooms for customers/investors/opportunities

### Why increase your “surface area for luck”
- Serendipity is people-driven: more high-quality touchpoints → more inbound/outbound opportunities
- Community arbitrage: you’re already in a 6,500+ member network (Slack, mentors, alumni) predisposed to help you
- Do what others won’t: small contrarian actions (phone calls, authentic updates) break through noise

### Core principles

| Principle                       | Why it matters                                                                 | Example                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Be specific and relevant        | Busy people reply to crisp asks that benefit them/their network               | “Can you intro me to Joanne re: X? Draft below + why it helps her students” |
| Short + clear CTA               | TL;DR wins; put the ask at the top                                            | “Could you intro? 3 lines of context. 20-min call next Tue/Wed?”        |
| Multi-channel, polite persistence | 7–8 touchpoints across channels outperform one-and-done                       | LinkedIn DM → email → comment → event hello → value add follow-up       |
| Warm intros > cold outreach     | Transfer of trust increases response rates                                     | Mutual contact tee-up with double opt-in                                |
| Make it easy to help            | Provide intro blurb, one-liner, links, scheduling                             | “Here’s a 5-line intro, my Calendly, and the specific value for them”   |
| Relationship bank account       | Add value before withdrawals; don’t spam                                      | Share notes, wins, intros; close loops; say thanks                      |

### Tactics that work (stories)

| Tactic                                  | Story/Proof                                                                                 | Takeaway                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Pick up the phone                        | Called PwC HR instead of only submitting CV → surfaced app → got the job                    | Do the unconventional, simple thing others fear           |
| Post publicly (even if small reach)      | Facebook post → soccer invite → maternity cover → first AU job                               | Weak ties create strong outcomes                          |
| Join communities, show up                | Mad Paws/Expert360 early roles → hypergrowth exposure                                        | Proximity compounds; be in the room                       |
| Ask “who do I want to meet and why” first| Clarity drives targeted outreach                                                             | Define ICP stakeholders and specific asks                 |

### Practical outreach playbook

| Situation            | Steps                                                                                             | Template cues                                                                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warm intro request   | Identify mutual; send double opt-in blurb; keep it short; clear value for target                  | Subject: Intro request to {Name} re {specific}; 3-line ask; 3-line bio; 1 link; 2 timeslots     |
| Cold DM/email        | Relevance hook; ask first; why them; proof; CTA                                                   | “Could we do 15 min on {topic} next Tue/Wed? 2 reasons this is relevant to you: …”              |
| Follow-up cadence    | 7–8 touches across 2–3 channels; vary medium; add value; space politely                           | Comment on their post; share resource; short bump; event hello                                  |
| Close the loop       | After intro/call, thank both; share outcome; note next steps                                      | “Quick update: great chat with X; next step Y; thanks again!”                                   |

### High-quality intro mechanics (the “dance”)
1) Asker (you) → Introducer: specific ask + draft intro + why relevant
2) Introducer → Target: double opt-in (“Interested?”)
3) If yes: Introducer sends intro thread
4) You reply-all with thanks + BCC introducer + propose times
5) After meeting: update both; add value back; keep notes

### Tools, hacks, and hygiene
- LinkedIn Contact Info: many list emails/phones; check first
- CRM: Track every relationship; tasks for follow-ups (don’t leak leads)
- VA leverage: Inbox triage and CRM tasking 1–2h/day
- Short video when useful: product walkthroughs post-pitch; avoid AI-generic spam
- LOIs/MOUs and preorders: validate demand if product not live (especially B2B/high-ticket)

### Benchmarks and pacing

| Stage                      | Practical bar                                                                   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outreach volume            | 25 targeted connects/day or 50/week; 5–10 thoughtful DMs/day                    |
| Touchpoints per target     | 5–8 over 3–6 weeks, multi-channel                                               |
| Response rates             | Warm intros 50%+; high-quality cold 15–25%                                      |
| Meetings                   | 10+ per week while building early pipeline                                      |

### Selected Q&A highlights

| Topic                                   | Takeaway                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reaching notable people                 | Be hyper-specific; value-first; use mutuals; double opt-in intros                                       |
| Video in outreach                       | Works post-interest for demos; avoid generic AI-personalized videos                                     |
| Older demographics (60–70)              | Use letters/phone/community orgs; LOIs/MOUs for intent; preorders/deposits for commitment               |
| African market focus                    | OK if AU/NZ founder link; customers can be global                                                       |
| Follow-up anxiety                       | Assume low attention, not rejection; keep it short, helpful, spaced; change channel                     |

### Practical metrics you can choose
- Top-of-funnel: connection accept rate; reply rate (warm vs cold); meetings booked
- Mid-funnel: meeting-to-next-step; intros generated per meeting; LOIs/preorders
- Relationship quality: number of meaningful contributors; closed-loop % after intros
- Hygiene: % contacts with next task; follow-up SLA; touches per priority lead

### Workshop logistics and follow-ups

|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Startmate network            | Use Slack to DM mentors/alumni; ask for double opt-in intros                              |

| Recommended practice         | Draft 3 intro requests today; send with blurb; book 5 meetings this week                 |

### Immediate actions (this week)
1) Define who and why: draft a 150-person target list; tag mutuals
2) Write 3 intro requests with double opt-in blurbs; send today
3) Ship 10 cold DMs with a one-sentence ask and 2 reasons it helps them
4) Stand up CRM + VA workflow to prevent lead leakage
5) Close the loop on every intro within 24–72 hours; log outcomes and next steps
