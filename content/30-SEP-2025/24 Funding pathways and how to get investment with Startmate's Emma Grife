### Session context
- Format: Masterclass + live Q&A with slides and resources
- Speaker: Emma Grife, Accelerator Lead at Startmate; ex-Insight Partners (growth VC, $10M+ checks)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmagrife/
- Focus: Australian funding landscape, Startmate programs, practical fundraising advice

### Four main funding sources

#### 1. Angel Investors
**Who they are:**
- High net worth individuals investing personal money
- Former founders, industry executives, successful operators, VCs investing personally
- Can invest via syndicates or direct checks

**What they care about:**
- **Founder**: Your background, expertise, ambition to execute
- **Vision**: Large potential outcome (not small business opportunities)

**Examples in Australia:**
- **First Believers**: Startmate's angel training program → creates active angel network
- **Ozzy Angels**: Platform for syndicate deals + network connections
- **City groups**: Brisbane Angels, Sydney Angels (monthly pitch meetings, pooled capital)

#### 2. Venture Capital Firms
**Structure:**
- Collect money from Limited Partners (LPs): pension funds, universities, high net worth individuals
- Have investment mandates: geography, stage, sector, check size
- Fiduciary responsibility to return investment to LPs

**What they care about (varies by stage):**
- **Early stage**: Founder expertise, product impressiveness, vision, some progress
- **Later stage**: More emphasis on traction, revenue, growth metrics
- **All stages**: Venture-scalable outcome (potential for $100M+ business, not lifestyle business)

**Australian examples:**
- **Startmate**: Pre-seed/seed, very early stage
- **Blackbird, AirTree**: Seed/Series A focused
- **Peak XV**: Multi-stage

#### 3. Grants
**Characteristics:**
- Typically don't need to be repaid
- From government entities or private bodies
- Very specific eligibility criteria
- Competitive application process

**Best for:**
- Research-focused companies
- Deep tech/hardware startups
- Less applicable for pure software plays

**Key insight:** Align with grant holder's objectives and development goals

#### 4. Debt Funding
**When it makes sense:**
- Capital-intensive businesses (hardware, deep tech)
- Companies with revenue/predictable cash flow
- Not common for early-stage software startups

**Australian options:**
- **Tractor Ventures**: Venture debt specialist for hardware/deep tech
- **Westpac**: Early-stage business loan program for startups

### Funding stages overview

| Stage | Typical investors | Focus |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| **Pre-seed** | Angels, early VCs | Founder, vision, early validation |
| **Seed** | VCs, some angels | Product-market fit, early traction |
| **Series A+** | Growth VCs | Proven business model, scaling |
| **Growth** | Growth equity | Significant revenue, market expansion |

**Note:** Pre-seed and seed can be interchangeable; no hard cutoffs between stages

### Fundraising strategy insights

#### Timing approaches
**Concentrated approach (recommended for prepared founders):**
- 30+ meetings in one week

**Learning approach (for earlier founders):**
- Sprinkle VC conversations while building
- Understand investor focus and questions

- Minimum 6 months between pitches to same investor if rejected

#### Relationship building
**European-style approach works in Australia:**
- Start relationships before needing money
- Send monthly updates to interested investors
- Include: key metrics, wins, challenges, asks for help
- Material improvement required for re-engagement

### Valuation considerations (pre-seed)
**Factors that influence valuation:**
- Investor type and investment philosophy
- Your background and expertise
- Amount you're raising and timeline to milestones
