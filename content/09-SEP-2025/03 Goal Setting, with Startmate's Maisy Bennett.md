### Why set goals

| Purpose            | Why it matters                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Focus              | Avoid working on the wrong things                                               |
| Speed              | Clear direction accelerates prioritization and delivery                         |
| Fundraising        | Provides milestones to work back from investor expectations                     |

### Core principle: Inputs over outputs

| Focus area   | Input you control                         | What it answers                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Product      | Customer interviews, user tests           | Are we building the right thing?                  |
| Distribution | ICP definition, channels, messaging tests | Who to sell to, where to find them, how to pitch  |

### Stages and typical goals

| Stage | Description                               | Common goals                                                                                                 |
|------:|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Validate idea                              | 15+ interviews/week; deep problem mapping; 50+ waitlist by week 6–7; low‑fi wireframes                       |
| 2     | Build MVP                                  | Continue interviews; MVP milestones/dates; user tests; define value/retention metrics                        |
| 3     | Get users                                  | DAU/WAU targets; activation; “customer love” signals; convert signups to active use                          |
| 4     | Revenue                                    | Turn on revenue; aim ~10% WoW (≈40% MoM) after first \$; pace toward ~\$1M ARR in ~12 months (venture path)   |

### Three goal types to set every cycle

| Goal type         | Examples (pick what fits)                                                                                          | Anti-patterns                         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Customer-centric  | Interviews/demos per week; live usability sessions; booked discovery calls                                          | Counting survey responses             |
| Product           | DAU/WAU; activation rate; retention; feature adoption; explicit “value/love” metric; MVP/beta milestones and dates | Vague outputs without success criteria |
| Revenue/Demand    | Presales; paid pilots; signed LOIs; MRR/ARR; # paying customers; GMV                                                | Waiting indefinitely to charge        |

### Benchmarks and pacing

| Milestone            | Best-in-class guide                                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Post first revenue   | ~10% WoW growth (≈40% MoM)                                   |
| Year-1 venture bar   | Rough path toward ~\$1M ARR in ~12 months (model dependent)  |

### Example: Input pivots to hit MRR

| Iteration | Outreach inputs                                   | Result (MRR) | Notes                                                           |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| v1        | 210 cold outbound emails                           | ~\$2k         | Insufficient velocity                                            |
| v2        | 1,000 low-touch + 10 high-touch warm intros        | ~\$3k         | Added high-touch leverage                                        |
| v3        | 2,000 low-touch + maintain 10 high-touch           | ~\$5k → \$8k   | ~50% MoM growth; momentum into demo day                          |

### Mindset checks

| Question                                             | Action if “No”                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Building the right product?                          | Pivot features/solution after customer insights                                  |
| Does anyone care (enough to use/pay repeatedly)?     | Rework positioning, channel, and offer; increase interviews and tests            |
| Talking to enough customers?                         | Raise interview/demos target; try unconventional outreach                        |

### Selected Q&A highlights

| Topic                                  | Takeaway                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No MVP yet (validation)                | Stay in problem space first; map pains, workflows, buyer vs user; prototype later                                      |
| Selling to government/defense (B2G)    | Fewer design partners; find internal champions; go deep with 3–5 orgs                                                 |
| Proof vs actual revenue                | LOIs/paid pilots can work if backed by extensive discovery and credible buyers                                         |
| Incentivizing interviews               | Consumer incentives can help; B2B: lead with empathy and co-creation, not early hard sell                             |
| Differentiation in crowded AI          | Sharpen unique value and positioning; use structured frameworks (e.g., Lenny’s resources)                              |
| D2C and B2B simultaneously             | Explore both in interviews briefly, then pick one to execute; don’t build/sell both at once early                      |
| When to charge (AI/agents)             | First prove usage/obsession (DAU/WAU, activation). Decide free trial/freemium/per-seat/usage; then monetize            |
| MVP “speed” complaints                 | Treat as real; fix performance; confirm willingness to pay if fast                                                     |

### 8-week goal template (fill this in)

| Area     | Baseline (now)                     | Goal (8 weeks)                                  | Weekly target                      | Success criteria (how you’ll know)                    |
|----------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Customer | X interviews/demos per week        | Total Y interviews/demos; Z design partners      | ≥ N per week                        | Qualified ICPs; actionable insights per week          |
| Product  | Current milestone status           | MVP/beta dates; features; UX validation          | Weekly build + test cadence         | DAU/WAU = A; activation ≥ B%; retention ≥ C%          |
| Revenue  | \$MRR and # paying customers        | Reach \$Z MRR; add P paying customers             | 10% WoW growth after first dollar   | LOIs/presales/pilots convert to paid usage            |
