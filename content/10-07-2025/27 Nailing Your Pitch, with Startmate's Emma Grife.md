## Title: Nailing Your Pitch, with Startmate's Emma Grife

### Session context
- Format: Comprehensive masterclass + live Q&A with slide examples
- Speaker: Emma Grife, Accelerator Lead at Startmate; ex-VC (2000+ pitch decks reviewed annually)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmagrife/
- Goal: Master both pitch deck creation and investor meeting dynamics

### Why pitch decks matter

#### The investor reality
- **Volume**: VCs see 1000+ pitch decks per year, invest in only a few
- **Purpose**: Get investors interested enough to want a second conversation
- **Not comprehensive**: Don't need to answer every question in the deck
- **First impression**: Bare minimum to get in the door

#### What makes investors excited (3 pillars)
1. **Desirable**: Evidence customers really want what you've built
2. **Feasible**: Realistic to build and bring to market
3. **Viable**: Big enough opportunity for unicorn-scale business

#### The storytelling test
**Why it matters**: Best storytellers get:
- Better investors (can communicate vision compellingly)
- Better customers (empathize with pain points)
- Better team members (inspire through clear communication)

**Balance required**: Logic + emotion (data + excitement)

### The 10-slide pitch deck framework

#### Essential slides (in suggested order)
1. **Title slide**: Logo, contact, one-liner
2. **Vision**: Ambitious future state
3. **Team**: Why you're the right people
4. **Problem**: Customer pain point
5. **Validation**: Evidence problem is real
6. **Solution**: How you solve it
7. **Traction**: Progress to date
8. **Market size**: Opportunity scale
9. **Go-to-market**: How you'll reach customers
10. **Competition**: Competitive landscape

**Flexibility**: Order can change based on your story flow

### Slide-by-slide breakdown

#### Slide 1: Title
**Must include:**
- Company logo
- Contact information (email, phone)
- One-liner: Clear sentence explaining what you do

**Why critical**: Investors should understand your business from slide 1
**Avoid**: Non-informative first slides that leave investors guessing

#### Slide 2: Vision
**Purpose**: Show ambitious long-term thinking
**Include**: How you see the future differently; 5-10 year impact vision
**VC perspective**: "Can my 10-20% ownership return my entire fund?"
**Key**: Must show commitment to venture-scale outcome

#### Slide 3: Team
**Most important at early stage**: When you lack customers/revenue, you ARE the product
**Focus on**: Achievements relevant to this specific problem
**Include**: Domain expertise, lived experience, ability to attract talent
**VC question**: "Do I want to spend time with this person? Will they run through walls?"

**Example**: FMCG automation founder with 10 years managing \$60M trade spend at Nestle

#### Slide 4: Problem
**Approach**: Use customer stories or process examples
**Quantify**: Time wasted, money lost, inefficiencies created
**VC lens**: "Is this a hair-on-fire problem?" (extremely acute and painful)
**Format**: Before state that's clearly broken/frustrating

#### Slide 5: Validation
**Evidence types**: Customer interviews, waitlist signups, early pilots, quotes
**Purpose**: Prove this problem needs solving urgently
**Quality over quantity**: Deep insights matter more than interview count
**Include**: Specific learnings that shaped your solution

#### Slide 6: Solution
**Structure**: Paint before/after picture
**Include**: ROI numbers when possible (time saved, money saved, efficiency gained)
**VC question**: "Does this actually solve the customer problem? Is it 10x better?"
**Focus**: Outcome benefits, not feature lists

#### Slide 7: Traction
**Critical**: Always include numbers, even if small
**No numbers = assumption of no progress**
**Must include**: Timeframe context
- "20 customer interviews in 2 years" = not impressive
- "20 customer interviews last week" = impressive

**Types**: Product milestones, revenue, partnerships, pre-sales, user metrics
**VC focus**: "Is this company growing fast? How much progress?"

### Pitch deck best practices

#### What NOT to do
- Legal disclaimers (unnecessary)
- NDAs (slows process, not needed)
- Too many adjectives (sounds like exaggeration)
- More than 20 words per slide
- Complicated infographics
- Spelling mistakes (surprisingly common)

#### What TO do
- Get professional design help if needed
- Keep to ~10 slides maximum
- Use headings that tell the story
- Make slides readable in 30 seconds
- Include concrete data over opinions
- Focus on customer value creation

#### Advanced technique: Story-telling headings
Instead of: "Problem"
Use: "FMCG industry wastes \$2B annually on inefficient trade promotions"

### Investor meeting structure (30 minutes)

#### Time breakdown
- **5 minutes**: Introductions
- **5 minutes**: Your overview ("Tell me about what you've built")
- **20 minutes**: Q&A (most important part)

#### Meeting preparation
**Research**: Know the VC firm, their portfolio, investment thesis
**Tailor**: Adjust technical depth based on their background
**Focus**: Value creation, not tiny details
**Avoid**: Marching through deck slide-by-slide

#### During the meeting
**Use deck as reference**: Pull up slides when helpful for explanation
**Track questions**: Write down what they ask (reveals pitch gaps)
**Be concise**: Quantify everything, avoid adjectives
**Stay high-level**: Don't get lost in implementation details

### Presentation vs. reading decks

#### Presentation deck (3-minute pitch)
- Mostly visuals
- Minimal words
- You tell the story
- Focus on key slides: problem, validation, solution, traction

#### Reading deck (investor sharing)
- Still max 20 words per slide
- Slightly more context than presentation version
- Can be sent before/after meetings
- Used for warm introductions

### Special considerations

#### Early-stage founders (validation phase)
**Focus majority on**: What you've learned from customer conversations
**Combine slides**: Vision + product roadmap, market + validation
**Emphasize**: Speed of learning, customer insights, iteration ability

#### Crowded markets
**Shift focus**: Less time on problem (already established)
**Emphasize**: Unique insight, differentiated approach, why you'll win
**Address**: What others have missed, your unfair advantage

#### Forecasting (avoid at early stage)
**Why bad**: No credibility, especially 5-year projections
**Alternative**: Show pipeline ("2 paying customers, 20 in pipeline")
**Focus**: Concrete progress over speculative projections

### Key success patterns

#### Top 3 consistent winners
1. **Unique customer insight**: What you know that others don't
2. **Team authority**: Why you're best person to solve this
3. **Speed/traction**: Quantified progress with timeframes

#### The "top 10 expert" test
**Goal**: Become top 10 expert in the world on your customer
**Not academic expertise**: Deep understanding of customer problems/behavior
**Evidence**: Quality of customer conversations, insights gained, iteration speed

### Common Q&A insights

#### Feasibility for AI startups
- Less critical than hardware/deep tech
- Assume AI solutions are feasible
- Focus on why/what, not technical how

#### B2C vs. B2B traction
- No universal "right" number of interviews
- Quality of insights > quantity of conversations
- Case-by-case based on industry and problem complexity

#### Two-sided marketplaces
- Understand both sides deeply
- Focus on who's paying you
- Address pain points for both user types

### Immediate action items

1. **Create your one-liner**: Clear sentence explaining what you do
2. **Identify your spike**: Which of the 3 success patterns (insight/team/traction) is strongest?
3. **Quantify everything**: Replace adjectives with numbers and timeframes
4. **Practice the 30-second test**: Can someone understand each slide in 30 seconds?
5. **Prepare for investor roulette**: Use as practice for pitch night feedback

### Upcoming opportunities
- **Investor Roulette**: 15-minute slots with investors for feedback
- **Pitch Night**: 3-minute presentations to founder community
- **Accelerator Info Session**: Tomorrow 5pm for application details

**Bottom line**: Great pitch decks are clear, concise stories that prove you understand your customer better than anyone else and can execute faster than competitors. Focus on evidence over adjectives, progress over perfection.
