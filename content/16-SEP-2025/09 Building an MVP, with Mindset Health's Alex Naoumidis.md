### About the speaker (Alex Naoumidis)
- Role: Co-founder & CEO, Mindset Health (digital therapeutics; e.g., Nerva for IBS)
- Background: Accounting/finance student → self-taught developer with his brother → YC alum → scaled to 40+ team, $30M raised
- Focus: Foundation model for psychophysiology; AI-powered therapeutics
- Hard-won lessons: Shipped complex product too slowly at first; pivoted to “good but small,” tight build–talk–iterate loop

### What is an MVP (and why it matters)

| Principle             | Why it matters                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Good but small        | Validates core value; eliminates bloat; avoids “barely functional” pitfalls    |
| Ship fast             | Increases iteration speed and “surface area for luck”                          |
| Talk to users         | Reality-checks assumptions; guides what to double down on or kill              |
| Charge early          | Free users ≠ paying users; pricing tests validate real willingness to pay      |

### Core concept: Narrow slice of quality (not a crappy prototype)

| Attribute     | Minimum bar for MVP                                | Anti-patterns                                    |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| UX/Usability  | Clear path to value; simple, intuitive flow         | Confusing IA, broken onboarding                  |
| Reliability   | Stable, non-buggy core journey                      | Crashes, data loss, flaky steps                  |
| Scope         | One job-to-be-done; smallest path to outcome        | Feature-stack, scope creep, “nice-to-haves”      |

### What not to do vs what to do

| Don’t do                                          | Do instead                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Build in a vacuum for months                      | Launch in 1–2 weeks; iterate in public with users                                            |
| Cargo-cult without understanding                  | Copy best practices for non-core UX with explicit reasons                                    |
| Delay charging                                    | Use trials/pre-orders; price via market proxies and value framing                            |
| Over-index on brand fear early                    | Assume few will notice; prioritize solving the user’s problem quickly                        |

### MVP testing before building

| Funnel test                | Tooling stack                                 | What you learn                                              |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Demand via pre-orders     | Ads → Unbounce → Typeform quiz → checkout     | CAC-to-preorder, message–market fit, pricing sanity         |
| Offer resonance           | Landing variants, value props, proofs         | Which promises/claims drive intent                          |
| Manual sales              | 15-min consult calls                          | Live objections, language, positioning to productize        |

### Pricing and charging

| Tactic                 | Guidance                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proxy pricing          | Anchor to familiar comparables (e.g., Noom, category norms)              |
| Value-based framing    | Price to outcome/value, not cost-plus                                   |
| Early monetization     | 7-day trial with card-on-file is effective; avoid “too cheap” distortion |

### Copying vs “cargo culting”

| Copy this (non-core)           | Don’t copy blindly                                                         |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Navigation, progress, layout   | Unknown/low-impact patterns without a reason; understand “why” it works    |
| Messaging patterns             | Features that are central to another app but not to your core              |

### Do things that don’t scale

| Motion                   | Purpose                                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1:1 calls/DMs           | Rapid learning; conversion practice              |
| Community outreach      | Find users where they live (subreddits, FB, etc.)|
| Manual onboarding       | Understand activation steps to later automate    |

### Platform choices (web vs mobile; iOS vs Android)

| Decision              | Practical guidance                                                                            |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web vs Mobile        | Choose the fastest medium that validates learning; web is often faster to ship                |
| iOS first            | Typically monetizes better and is simpler early                                                |
| When Android matters | If distribution (e.g., clinician referrals) demands device-agnostic delivery                   |

### Build loop to product–market fit

| Step     | Focus                                               | Output                                                |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Define   | Sharpest pain + smallest cohort                     | One job-to-be-done                                    |
| Build    | “Good but small” MVP                                | Minimal screens/steps to outcome                      |
| Charge   | Price proxy + trial                                 | Real willingness-to-pay signal                        |
| Learn    | Daily user conversations + data                     | Keep/kill list; clarified next iteration              |
| Iterate  | Weekly releases                                     | Momentum and compounding insight                      |

### Stages and typical goals

| Stage | Description         | Common goals                                                                                   |
|------:|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Validate idea       | 15–20 interviews/week; map pains/jobs; 50–100 waitlist; pre-orders via funnel                |
| 2     | Build MVP           | Ship in 1–2 weeks; usability tests; define activation/retention metrics                      |
| 3     | Get users           | DAU/WAU targets; activation ≥ threshold; qualitative “love” signals                          |
| 4     | Revenue             | Turn on revenue; aim ~10% WoW (≈40% MoM) post–first dollar (venture path dependent)          |

### Selected Q&A highlights

| Topic                                   | Takeaway                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pricing unknowns                        | Use market proxies + value framing; don’t underprice; pricing is a learning vehicle                            |
| Pivoting with paying users              | Ship better; refund if needed; brand damage fear is overrated early                                            |
| Non-technical founders                  | You become technical by building; AI-assisted dev compresses timelines to weeks                                |
| Freemium vs paywall                     | Both can work; avoid “free out of fear”; trials with card-on-file convert well                                 |
| Domains for MVP                         | Ship on main domain; use dev/prod envs; few will notice early                                                  |
| iOS vs Android                          | iOS often monetizes better; Android if strategic (e.g., clinician referrals)                                   |
| Handling demand spikes                  | “Champagne problem”; extend support hours, then add process/people                                             |
| Credibility for clinicians              | Ladder: testimonials → modality evidence → partner’s research → your observational data → your RCT             |
| B2C → B2B2C motion                      | Follow organic signals (patients telling doctors); formalize provider channel                                   |
| Fundraising signals                     | Early VCs back team/resourcefulness; revenue is strong if applicable; show you can ship and learn fast         |

### Benchmarks and pacing

| Milestone             | Guidepost                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Post first revenue    | ~10% WoW growth (≈40% MoM)                                                |
| Year-1 venture path   | Rough trajectory toward ~$1M ARR in ~12 months (model/market dependent)   |

| Manual sales              | 10–20 high-touch calls/week; script objections; update copy                             |
| Funnel tests              | 2–3 landing variants; message, pricing, proof toggles                                   |
| Evidence stack            | Testimonials; modality research; partner credibility; early observational data           |

### Action items

| Step | Action                                                                                           |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Define the sharpest user pain and the smallest cohort                                            |
