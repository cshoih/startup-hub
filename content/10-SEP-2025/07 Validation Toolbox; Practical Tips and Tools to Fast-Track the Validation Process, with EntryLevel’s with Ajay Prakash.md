## Title: Ajay — Zero to One: Validate Fast, Sell Faster

### Session context

- Speaker: Ajay (Founder, EntryLevel; acquired by HEX), angel investor (35–37 startups), writer (Ajay’s Quest ~5k subs), growth lead for a stealth California company.
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajayvprakash/
- Past: Gov/enterprise tech (SG), carbon registry (Bahamas), differential privacy (India), many experiments (beer, Pokémon arbitrage, phone build).
- Focus today: Zero to One — mock it up and get someone to pay. Everything else later.

### Core loop and philosophy

|Step|Question|What to do|Move on if|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Problem selection|Obsess over a problem, not a product|It’s lukewarm, tiny, or requires market education|
|2|Problem checklist|Paid-for, big market, end-of-one, within capability, users aware of problem|Any “no” on these for now|
|3|Minimal Viable Test (MVT)|1–24 hour validation; build decks, landing pages, Stripe link, demos|No credible signal in 24–72h|
|4|PMF check|Are people paying and satisfied? Growth consistent?|If not, add JTBD (features) or switch idea|
|5|Scale|When $1 reliably becomes >$1 back, scale spend; otherwise keep sweat, not cash|Don’t prematurely scale|

### What counts as PMF (Ajay’s bar)

- Money + satisfaction + consistent growth. If you have to ask, you probably don’t have PMF.
- Engineers overwhelmed, marketers idle = PMF signal.
- Avoid micro-optimizations pre-PMF; take big swings (new offers, pages, pricing, segments).

### High-velocity validation

|Tactic|How|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Money now|Deck + Stripe link; invoice; prepay; refundable if needed|Be human; refund 100–200% if you must smooth over|
|Parallel experiments|Run 3–4 thoughtful tests (quality bar is higher now)|“Focus” is for after something works|
|Weird first|Ship bold, non-obvious features early|Customers won’t ask for the weird stuff|
|Add JTBD|If one feature isn’t enough, expand scope to complete the job|E.g., beyond “sign” to full document workflow|

### Selected examples and results

|Experiment|Approach|Result|Decision|
|---|---|---|---|
|FeatureProof (exec deep-tech briefings)|Canva deck + 100 emails + Stripe|~$3k in 5 days|Refunded; not pursuing|
|EntryLevel (6-week automated bootcamps)|Webflow site + custom viral loop|30k signups in 30 days; later $100k MRR burst|Doubled down; eventual acquisition by HEX|
|Virtual Coaching (career/PT)|Simple offer|~$300 MRR|Dropped|
|HireFlux (no-resume recruitment)|Verbal enterprise close pending|Would make $|Killed on mission misalignment|

### Two breakout growth bets (no A/B testing)

- Viral loop campaign via FB ads + groups: 0 → 30k signups in 30 days.
- 100% refund on course completion + upsell loop: 0 → $100k MRR in months; 75% retained funds despite refund offer.

### Money, risk, and spend

|Principle|Guidance|
|---|---|
|Spend timing|$1k–$5k max on unproven ideas; scale only when $1 consistently returns >$1|
|Risk profile|Risk time and looking foolish; don’t risk ethics. Be resourceful before cash-heavy|
|Build cost|MVPs can be <$1.5k using="" no-code="" AI="" (Bubble="" dev,="" design,="" Stripe)=""|
|Don’t educate the market|Prioritize problems users already know they have|

### B2B specifics

|Objective|Tactics|
|---|---|
|Fast validation|LOIs/MOUs (non-binding), paid pilots, presales|
|List building|Contactout/SignalHire/Apollo; Crunchbase for founders; scrape and segment|
|Cold outreach fatigue|Use creative copy, relevance, humor; consider a focused newsletter funnel to warm leads|
|Credibility|Ship assets (decks, demos, calculators), show ROI math|

### Marketplaces and D2C notes

- Marketplaces: Set a higher success bar; think viral stunts/drop marketing for 30k+ users or 500+ B2B leads.
- D2C apps: Freemium baseline is high (SF sees “1M user” pop-ups frequently). Study/clone winning onboarding/paywalls (e.g., Breathwrk, Zing Coach, Cal AI).

### Playbooks and tools

|Category|Tools/Ideas|
|---|---|
|Landing/prototyping|GPT + Cursor for site; Bubble, Zapier; Gumloop; Typeform/Stripe links|
|Design/branding|Latest GPT image tools are now “good enough” for logos/visual systems|
|Data & outreach|Contactout, Apollo; LinkedIn scraping (mind legality); Crunchbase targeting|
|Hosting|Keep costs near zero; static + serverless as needed|

### Ajay’s 24-hour challenge (adapted)

|Step|Deliverable|Acceptance criteria|
|---|---|---|
|1|One-liner problem + target user|Problem is known/paid-for by user|
|2|Asset|Deck OR 1-page site with Stripe link OR demo video|
|3|Outreach|100 targeted emails/DMs; or 10 high-intent buyers|
|4|Signal|Ideally $ collected; else LOIs/pilot commits; else clear “no” with learning|
|5|Debrief|What to change tomorrow (offer, segment, channel, JTBD)|

### Q&A highlights (selected)

|Topic|Takeaway|
|---|---|
|Hard-to-sell in 24h|Raise advances, pilot fees, or push for LOIs; otherwise set a much bigger growth bar|
|Courses and exits|Course businesses are hard to sell; sell distribution (users) or platform/IP (LMS) instead|
|Ethics of pre-selling|Don’t announce “not built”; sell, then deliver or refund (100–200% if needed to delight)|
|Branding tools|New GPT image/design tools produce strong brand assets quickly|
|LOI structure|Simple non-binding MOU; ask AI to draft; fill in terms|
|“Fake social proof”|Omitted on-record; use judgment and ethics|
|Habits app monetization|Charge user or copy proven freemium funnels/paywalls; study winning flows|
|Lists for outreach|Use Contactout/Apollo; but win with copy, not just lists|

### Mindset guardrails

|Pitfall|Better approach|
|---|---|
|Micro-optimizing early|Swing big (new segments, offers, pages, pricing)|
|Educating the market|Solve problems people already feel acutely|
|Clinging to mid-opportunities|Kill the “3/10” idea; seek the fast, hard hit|
|Overspending early|Constrain budget; force resourcefulness|
