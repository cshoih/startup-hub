## Title: How to Conduct Customer Interviews, with Freckle’s Nathan Merzvinskis 

### Session context

- Format: Talk + live Q&A + doc walkthrough (pre-mortem, interview guide, pricing survey, design partner program)
- Host: Michael Batko (Startmate); Speaker: Nathan Merzvinskis (Freckle; ex-Everproof → acquired by Go1; ex-Schedulo)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-merzvinskis/
- Focus: End-to-end customer discovery system from idea → MVP → pricing → ongoing feedback loops

### Why customer interviews (beyond “talk to users”)

- Reduce time-to-wrong: validate need, ICP, and monetization before building
- Build champions: discovery participants become design partners, then first paying customers
- Fundraising edge: evidence-rich discovery (transcripts, tagged insights, quotes) answers investor risks upfront

### Core workflow overview

|Stage|Purpose|Output|
|---|---|---|
|Pre-mortem|Identify top risks/assumptions|Clustered assumptions/failure reasons; prioritized risk quadrant|
|Interview guide|Non-leading, specific questions|30–45 min script centered on real tasks, events, and pains|
|Synthesis|Turn qual into decisions|Tagged insights; persona fit/no-fit; next tests|
|Design partner program|Repeatable feedback mechanism|5–10 partners; biweekly sessions; clear give/get; path to paid|
|Pricing discovery|Test value metric + willingness to pay|Van Westendorp range + pricing hypotheses|
|Ongoing loops|Post-MVP prioritization and feature tradeoffs|Slack channels, rapid sprints, continual interviews|

### Pre-mortem (start here)

|Step|How|Why it matters|
|---|---|---|
|Solo brainstorm (20 min)|Green: “I assume that …”; Pink: “This failed because …”|Surfaces implicit beliefs and failure modes|
|Cluster + label|Combine into themes (pricing, ICP, regulation, competition, unit economics, etc.)|Reveals blind spots across co-founders|
|Prioritize on 2×2|Likelihood (low→high) vs Impact (low→high)|Focus interviews on top-right risks first|

Common top-right risks:

- Real need/pain priority for target user
- Willingness to pay / viable value metric
- ICP clarity (who buys, who uses)
- Regulatory or switching constraints (market dependent)

### Interview fundamentals

|Principle|Practice|
|---|---|
|Avoid bias|No pitching up front; disclose only the problem space; ask non-leading, specific, time-bound questions|
|Specific over general|“Walk me through yesterday” vs “usually”; “last time you …” vs “would you …”|
|Persona consistency|Run 6–7 interviews per persona; switch personas if you see weak pull|
|Record and tag|Get consent; use Fathom/Granola for transcripts; tag in Dovetail (or equivalent)|
|Build rapport, then dig|Reflect back terms; ask “Can you tell me more?”; chase throwaway comments|

Favorite question patterns:

- Context: “Was yesterday a typical workday? Walk me through it from start to finish.”
- Pain: “Top 3 biggest challenges last week? Which cost you time/money/stress?”
- Trigger: “Tell me about the last time you tried to solve this. What did you do first?”
- Substitutes: “What tools/spreadsheets/processes are you using now? What’s broken?”
- Constraints: “What would stop you switching? Who else needs to approve?”
- Value: “If this were solved, what improves? Time saved, revenue, risk, compliance?”
- Price framing (later): “At what point would this feel too cheap/too expensive?”

What not to do:

- Don’t pitch at the start
- Don’t ask hypotheticals (“Would you use/pay?”) without anchoring to past behavior
- Don’t skip qualitative before surveys or AI-simulated “users”

### Designing and running the guide

|Section|Examples|
|---|---|
|Primer|Explain discovery vs pitch; request permission to defer solution until end; ask to record|
|Kickoff|Role, responsibilities, tools, org structure|
|Day-in-the-life|Timeboxed walk-through; locate pain moments|
|Problem deep dive|Last incident, frequency, workaround, cost-of-pain|
|Alternatives|Current stack (incl. spreadsheets/do-nothing); switching frictions|
|Buying dynamics|Who decides; budget; procurement constraints|
|Wrap|Offer design partner slot; ask for 1–2 intros to similar peers|

Timebox: 30–45 minutes. Be explicit that you’ll read from a guide to stay on track.

### Synthesis and decision-making

|Tooling|Use|
|---|---|
|Dovetail (or Notion tags)|Upload transcripts; tag by theme (pricing, ICP, workflow, compliance, etc.)|
|Persona boards|SPICE framework: Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical event; include representative quotes|
|Risk tracker|Map new evidence back to pre-mortem clusters; mark validated/invalidated/unknown|

Stopping rule:

- After 6–7 consistent interviews per persona, you can usually predict answers → move to next risk or next persona.

### Design partner program (turn interviews into revenue)

|Element|Details|
|---|---|
|Who|5–10 ideal users with strong pain and engagement|
|Cadence|Biweekly 30–45 min sessions; Slack 1:1 channel for fast feedback|
|Give/get|Early access; 50% Y1 discount; input to roadmap; you get structured feedback and case study|
|Exit|Clear expectation to become paying customers post-beta if value delivered|

### Pricing discovery (when to run and how)

- Run after need and scope are clear; before heavy build
- Define value metric(s): seats, credits, usage unit most aligned with delivered value
- Use Van Westendorp (4 Qs) to get price bands; add willingness-to-pay probes in interviews
- Validate packaging and buyer economics in follow-ups; keep evidence for investors

Reference: Nathan’s Medium guide on pricing discovery (Van Westendorp) and value metrics.

### Post-MVP: keep interviewing

- Use interviews to prioritize features with equal build cost/time
- Set up 1:1 Slack channels with top customers (e.g., 25 key accounts)
- Continue short sprints: question set → calls → decision → ship

### Benchmarks and pacing

|Area|Practical bar|
|---|---|
|Interview volume|10–20 across 1–3 personas; 6–7 per persona before switching|
|Guide discipline|Non-leading, time-bound, past-behavior anchored|
|Evidence quality|Recorded, transcribed, tagged; quotes curated into persona boards and investor-ready notes|
|Conversion|20–50% of strong-need interviewees join design partner program|

### Selected Q&A highlights

|Topic|Takeaway|
|---|---|
|B2B vs B2C counts|Similar “6–7 per persona” rule; ensure persona consistency|
|Warm vs cold contacts|Warm enables lighter disclosure; still avoid pitching upfront|
|Competition|Not inherently bad; beware winner-takes-all markets; include substitutes and “do nothing”|
|Quant surveys/AI “fake users”|Use only after qualitative rounds; AI simulators miss serendipitous insights|
|Recording tools|Fathom (fast summaries), Granola (invisible presence), Dovetail for tagging|
|Fundraising without product|Possible with high-quality discovery evidence, mockups, and design partners|
|Post-launch interviews|Yes—use to choose between features with similar effort; maintain slack channels for continuous input|
|Feature whiplash|Keep 80/20: founder vision 80%, feedback 20%; avoid reactive, incoherent product|

### 8-week execution template (fill this in)

|Track|Baseline (now)|2-week goal|Weekly target|Success criteria|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Pre-mortem|Assumptions not captured|Run session; cluster and prioritize risks|—|Top-right risks defined for discovery focus|
|Interviews|0–5 recent convos|10 interviews across 1–2 personas|5–10/wk; recorded + tagged|6–7 consistent per persona; clear need signal|
|Synthesis|Unstructured notes|Dovetail/Notion board; SPICE personas with quotes|Update after each batch|Decisions logged; next hypotheses queued|
|Partners|None or ad hoc|5+ design partners confirmed|Biweekly sessions; Slack channels|Ongoing feedback; 50%+ convert to paid later|
|Pricing|Unclear value metric/WTP|Define metric(s); run VWSM survey with partners|5–10 responses|Price band + packaging hypothesis validated|

### Practical metrics you can choose

- Need strength: # interviews where pain ranks top 3; cost-of-pain evidence
- Signal quality: % of interviews producing referrals; willingness to be a design partner
- Pricing: VWSM acceptable range; early trial → paid conversion
- Evidence readiness: transcripts tagged; investor-ready quote board (“wall of love”)

### Workshop logistics and follow-ups

|Artifacts|Pre-mortem board; interview guide; SPICE persona boards; pricing survey; partner one-pager|
|Investor pack|Curated quotes, tagged insights, persona summaries, pricing results|

### Your 5 next actions

1. Schedule a 90-minute pre-mortem with your co-founder; prioritize top-right risks
2. Draft a 30–45 min non-leading interview guide; book 10 calls across 1–2 personas
3. Record, transcribe, and tag; create SPICE persona boards with verbatim quotes
4. Invite 5–10 strong-fit participants to a structured design partner program
5. Define value metric(s); run a Van Westendorp pricing survey with partners and synthesize results
