### Core growth framework: Full-funnel thinking

| Traditional Marketing | Growth Marketing |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Top-funnel focus (awareness, acquisition) | Full-funnel: Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral |
| Team of specialists | Cross-functional: marketing + data + product + engineering |
| Linear metrics (downloads, sales) | Trend analysis (WoW, MoM growth rates) |

**The flywheel effect**: Each stage feeds the next; happy users refer more users, creating compound growth

### Growth fundamentals (3 pillars)
1. **Product-market fit**: Stop feeling like pushing a boulder uphill; users beg for features
2. **Activation**: Get users to core value as quickly as possible (remove friction)
3. **Retention**: Help users experience core value as often as possible

### Customer research framework

| Research Type | Key Questions | Why It Matters |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Jobs-to-be-done | "What are you hiring this product for?" | Reframes competition (Uber vs. walking/taxi/public transport, not just Lyft) |
| Pain points | "What are your biggest challenges?" | Identifies messaging hooks |
| Behavior | "Walk me through the last time you..." | Shows actual vs. stated behavior |
| Language | "How would you describe this to a friend?" | Gets customer's words for your copy |

**Pro tip**: Phone/Zoom > surveys for follow-up questions and nuance

### Idea prioritization: ICE framework
Rate each idea 1-10 on:
- **Impact**: How much will this move the key metric?
- **Confidence**: How sure are you it will work?
- **Ease**: How much time/money/resources needed?

### Analytics foundation (critical for growth)
- **Central data system**: Segment, RudderStack to pipe data everywhere
- **Track every step**: Email sent → opened → clicked → landing page → form click → form submit
- **Find drop-offs**: Biggest conversion killer = highest priority fix
- **Example**: Spaceship saw 20% conversion boost by adding tooltip for tax file number field

### 19 Growth channels (Bullseye Framework)

| Channel | Best For | Key Insight |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Viral/Referral** | B2C, network effects | Must hit 3 metrics: Acquisition + Activation + Retention |
| **Targeting Blogs** | Niche B2C, B2B | Leverage existing trust vs. building your own |
| **PR/Publicity** | Trust building | Need repeatable angle, not just funding announcements |
| **Search Engine Marketing** | High-intent capture | Limited by search volume; great for existing demand |
| **Social/Display Ads** | Brand awareness | Lower intent than search |
| **SEO** | Long-term, cost-efficient | "Owning vs. renting" - compound returns |
| **Content Marketing** | B2B thought leadership | Pairs well with SEO |
| **Engineering as Marketing** | B2B lead generation | Tools/calculators that provide value (HubSpot Website Grader) |
| **Affiliate Programs** | Performance-based | Only pay for conversions |

**Golden rule**: Focus on 1-2 channels, not 19. Most successful companies grew primarily from one channel.

### Spaceship case study: 40k waitlist → \$100M AUM

**The viral waitlist mechanics**:
1. Enter email → "You're in group 36"
2. Complete profile + verify mobile → "Now you're in group 26"
3. Each referral = 5 groups up → "5 referrals gets you to group 1 (early access)"

**Why it worked** (consumer psychology):
- **FOMO**: Limited spots, group progression
- **Social proof**: Showing tweets from excited users
- **Gamification**: Clear path to "win" (early access)
- **Ease**: Pre-written share messages, one-click posting

**Trust-building tactics**:
- Mike Cannon-Brooks (angel investor) in ads
- Portfolio company logos people recognized
- Photoshopped user faces on planets → natural retweets
- Hand-written notes with swag to 5k+ follower users
- Events with known speakers (Jane Lu brought 400 attendees)

**Core insight**: Consumer psychology hasn't changed in thousands of years (FOMO, social proof). Only our ability to reach people has changed. Apply timeless psychology through modern channels.

### Key takeaways for early-stage founders

1. **Start with customer insights**: Survey continuously, use their language
2. **Build analytics foundation early**: Track every funnel step to find bottlenecks
3. **Focus on one channel**: Do it world-class vs. spreading thin
4. **Leverage existing trust**: Partner with established brands/influencers vs. building from scratch
5. **Test with MVPs**: Waitlist before product, landing page before building
6. **Think psychology first**: What motivates your user to take action?

### AI and SEO opportunity
Current AI search is easy to game - create branded review pages, optimize for AI overviews. "It's like 2008 SEO all over again" - early movers will compound advantages.

### Selected Q&A highlights

| Topic | Takeaway |
|-------|----------|
| Channel vs. message testing | Test messaging within each channel; stay consistent on core use cases |
| AI replacing SEO | AI search is nascent but growing; now is the time to optimize (like 2008 SEO) |
| Community building | Don't use for acquisition - too much work. Use existing communities instead |
| Data visualization tools | Mixpanel, Amplitude, Hotjar - focus more on central data management system |

**Final advice**: Nothing in marketing is truly new. Master timeless psychology, apply through modern channels, and measure everything.
