## Title: Monetisation and Pricing Strategies, with Oliver Berger

### Session context
- Format: Interactive masterclass + live Q&A with pricing examples
- Speaker: Oliver Berger, product and strategy advisor; ex-CPO at Stake, ex-MySpace, ex-eBay
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverberger/
- Focus: Value-based pricing fundamentals for early-stage founders

### Core pricing principles (the foundation)

**Price according to value delivered, not:**
- Time/hours spent
- Cost to build (COGS still matters for viability)
- Competitor pricing (use as reference, not anchor)
- What you think they'll pay (research what they actually will)
- Cheapest option to attract customers (race to the bottom)

**The transaction principle:**
Every purchase = exchange of currency for something more valuable to the customer
- Example: \$6.50 Big Mac is worth more to me than \$6.50 in my pocket
- Doesn't matter: cook time, ingredient cost, Burger King's price
- Only matters: perceived value to customer at moment of purchase

### Strategic pricing decisions: Margin vs. Growth

| Approach | When to choose | Trade-offs |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| **High margin** (price near perceived value) | Limited runway; need revenue fast; no network effects | Higher profit per customer; slower growth |
| **Growth focus** (price well below perceived value) | Network effects business; viral potential; scale advantages | Lower margin; faster user acquisition |

**Network effects consideration (key insight from session):**
- If your business benefits from more users (dating apps, social platforms, marketplaces)
- Value increases with each additional user
- Sacrifice early margin for long-term volume and network strength

### Pricing models breakdown

#### Freemium (best practices)
- **Give everything away, but in limited way** (not feature-gated)
- Example: Authority app - one group with 6 members vs. multiple groups with 12+ members
- **Highlight upgrade paths inside product experience**, not just pricing page
- **Avoid if:** high onboarding costs or small TAM
- **Laura's insight:** Friends experience full features when invited, creating viral demonstration

#### Free trials
- **Deeper usage, less viral** than freemium
- **Full experience matters** - remove friction to core value
- **Time limits create urgency** (Timothy's coffee: feedback required within 2 weeks)
- **QR codes for viral sharing** (Timothy's personalized coffee recipes)

#### Recurring revenue & bundles
- **Recurring revenue valued at higher multiples** than one-time sales
- **Bundle benefits unavailable elsewhere** (Disney+ subscribers get exclusive Disney World perks)
- **Requires hard choices** - some features/perks only for subscribers
- **Consumer psychology:** underestimate time value, use less than they pay for

### Pricing psychology: Anchoring

**Oliver's email calendar tool example:**
- Basic (\$4): Minimal features, almost useless
- Standard (\$5): Core value, positioned as "bargain"
- Premium (\$30): Over-featured for most users

**How anchoring works:**
1. Research optimal price point through surveys
2. Create "decoy" options above and below
3. Make target option appear as obvious middle choice
4. Drive behavior toward your preferred price

**Double-lever pricing (advanced):**
- Salesforce model: per user + per message/action
- Adds complexity but increases revenue potential
- Only recommend after establishing brand loyalty
- Can alienate early customers if introduced too soon

### Pricing research methods

#### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter (recommended)
Four questions to find acceptable price range:
1. **Too expensive:** "At what price would this be so expensive you wouldn't consider buying?"
2. **Too cheap:** "At what price would this seem so low-quality you wouldn't trust it?"
3. **Getting expensive:** "At what price does this start feeling expensive but you'd still consider it?"
4. **Bargain price:** "At what price would this be a great deal?"

**Result:** Identifies sweet spot where most customers feel comfortable (e.g., \$15-20 range)

#### A/B Price Testing (for larger samples)
- Split traffic: 100 users see \$10, 100 see \$15, 100 see \$20, 100 see \$25
- Measure conversion rates at each price point
- Find optimal price/conversion balance
- **Requires:** 400+ users for statistical significance
- **Cost:** Can be expensive but scientifically rigorous

#### Problems with traditional surveys
- **"How much would you pay?" = race to bottom**
- People always answer lowest possible amount
- Better approach: **"How much would you pay to solve this problem?"** (Tiana's insight)

### Pricing tips and tricks

| Tactic | Example | Psychology |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Remove dollar signs | "15" vs "\$15" | Reduces payment pain |
| End prices in 7 | \$97 vs \$100 | Perceived value (unconfirmed) |
| Term discounts vs upfront | "Stay 10 months, get 2 free" vs "Pay year upfront for discount" | Avoids procurement delays |

**WiseTech enterprise insight:**
- Instead of: "Pay \$400K upfront for discount"
- Try: "Stay 10 months, get November-December free"
- **Benefit:** Avoids 6-12 month procurement cycles
- **Trade-off:** Cash flow vs. faster deal closure

### Case studies from session

#### Authority (Laura) - Safety app for teens
- **Model:** Freemium with network effects
- **Free tier:** 1 group, 6 members, basic features
- **Paid tier:** Multiple groups, 12+ members, full features
- **Viral mechanism:** Friends experience full app when invited
- **Future:** Licensing to schools/youth organizations

#### Best Schools (Anthony) - School finder platform
- **Model:** Free for parents, paid for schools
- **Value prop:** School enrollment competitiveness (especially private schools)
- **Challenge:** "If every vendor says same thing, value prop weakens"
- **Solution:** Must be more valuable than alternatives, not just cheaper

#### Coffee customization (Timothy)
- **Model:** Paid product with viral QR codes
- **Free trial equivalent:** Discounted second bag if feedback provided within 1 week
- **Viral element:** QR codes link to personalized recipes, shareable by influencers
- **Bundle opportunity:** Exclusive grinder for subscribers

### Advanced considerations

#### Grandfathering price increases
**Key principles:**
1. **Never guarantee prices forever** in T&Cs
2. **Price increases now more acceptable** (post-Netflix/Uber era)
3. **Commercial decision:** Trust/longevity vs. revenue optimization
4. **Soften with added value:** "Price up 20%, but you now get X feature"

#### NDIS/Assistive technology (Avalon's challenge)
- **Situation:** NDIS pays up to \$500, but don't want to exploit users
- **Advantage:** High upper bound provides pricing flexibility
- **Approach:** Use pricing surveys to find fair value within range
- **Follow-up:** Complex case requiring individual consultation

#### Estate administration (Emmanuel)
- **Current:** \$150 flat fee per workspace (vs. \$15/month subscription)
- **Reasoning:** Periods of inactivity make monthly fees poor value
- **Price testing:** Increase price for new cohorts, measure stickiness
- **Legal professionals:** Free when invited, potential future revenue source

### Immediate action items

1. **Define your value proposition** in customer terms (problem solved, not features delivered)
2. **Choose margin vs. growth strategy** based on network effects and runway
3. **Run Van Westendorp survey** with 50-100 potential customers
4. **Set up pricing infrastructure** (Stripe/payment system) for easy price changes
5. **Plan messaging for price changes** - expect to iterate pricing within 12 months
6. **Test anchoring strategy** with 3-tier pricing structure

### Key takeaway
**Pricing will change** - everyone will adjust prices within 12 months. Focus on getting infrastructure and research methods right, then iterate based on real customer behavior and feedback.

**Final wisdom:** "If customers won't pay what you want, you're not valuable enough to them yet" - focus on increasing value before competing on price.
