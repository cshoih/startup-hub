## Title: Product-Market Fit in Practice — Segmentation, Differentiation, Validation (Kristin, Atlassian)

### Session context

- Speaker: Kristin (Atlassian; ex-BCG, Amazon, Zip, Xero; Startmate mentor)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinperchal/
- Theme: How to reach, recognize, and scale product-market fit (PMF)
- Focus: The 3X framework; multiple “types” of PMF; demand vs. supply; segmentation and differentiation; validation loops and signals

### The 3X framework (explore → expand → extract)

|Stage|Goal|Execution pattern|Primary risks|Strategy focus|Signal you’re moving on|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Explore|Discover PMF (pre-PMF)|Fast iterations, “throw spaghetti” tests|Tech feasibility; real market demand|Learning velocity; compounding insights|Effort down vs. learning up|
|Expand|Scale what works|Solve “whack-a-mole”; build defensible moat|Scaling model; profitable growth|Moat creation; distribution; share gain|Pull > push; chaotic growth|
|Extract|Efficiency at scale|Optimize for profit, efficiency|Disintermediation; stagnation|Defend/renew; portfolio discipline|Durable retention, margin expansion|

### Types of product-market fit and growth choices

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Feature–problem fit|Narrow feature solves 1 job well|Calendly (scheduling)|
|Customer–market fit|Solve a shared problem across segments|Slack (communication)|
|Deep solution fit|Go deep in a single function/domain|Workday (HR suite depth)|
|Solution–market fit|Own a category with a suite|Google Workspace (suite)|

### Growth decision after initial PMF: breadth vs. depth (pick one first)

- Breadth: Serve more customer segments with current solution.
- Depth: Serve the same customer with more jobs-to-be-done.
- Don’t try both at once early.

### PMF decomposition

|Component|Meaning|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Maturity/stage|Where you are on 3X|Align tactics to stage|
|Segmentation (who)|Precisely who you solve for|Drives GTM channels, pricing, needs|
|Differentiation|Why they choose you vs. alternatives|Drives roadmap, prioritization, wedge|

### Demand vs. supply: the core mental model

|Side|What it is|You control it?|What to do|
|---|---|---|---|
|Demand|Customer context, motivations, timing, status quo|No|Understand “struggling moment,” priorities, inertia|
|Supply|Your product, UX, offer, risk reduction|Yes|Map to demand context; reduce anxiety; deliver fast value|

### Demand-side “forces” to map

|Push (problem)|Pull (promise)|Inertia (habit)|Anxiety (new)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Struggling moment triggering change|Desired outcomes/benefits|Current workaround feels “good enough”|Fear of switching, failure, cost|

You’re closer to PMF when: Push + Pull > Inertia + Anxiety

### Interviewing and insight collection

|Principle|How to apply|
|---|---|
|Context makes the irrational rational|Keep digging; nothing is random|
|Avoid focusing illusion|Don’t lead with solution; learn the problem & priority first|
|Who to interview|Choosers: won, lost, churned, evaluators|
|When to stop|When you can predict answers (themes saturated)|
|What to capture|Struggle, motivation, blockers, anxieties, decision journey, context|
|Priority check|Ask where this ranks among their top 1–2 problems; below #2 = low traction|

### Segmentation, differentiation, and downstream choices

|Concept|Definition|Why it matters|
|---|---|---|
|Segmentation|The specific “who” you serve|Automatically constrains GTM, pricing, features|
|Differentiation|Why you win for that “who”|Focuses roadmap; creates a wedge; aids sales|

### Car rental example (segmentation clarity)

|Brand|Segment (who)|Product choices|Where they market|
|---|---|---|---|
|Hertz|Travelers away from home (rent by day)|Newer fleet; higher price|Consumer ads, travel channels|
|Enterprise|Drivers needing replacement car near home|Older fleet; convenient locations|Body shops, insurers, local|
|Zipcar|In-city, rent by hour for quick trips|On-street access; hourly pricing|Near transit, dense urban areas|

### Validation loop (tactical)

|Step|Action|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|1|Write assumptions (problem, who, value, risks)|Expose bias; set testable hypotheses|
|2|Interviews (demand-first)|Confirm problem priority; map forces|
|3|Prototype flows (Figma, etc.)|Reduce friction; test time-to-value|
|4|Run small offers (demo-first, paid consults, LOIs)|Separate signal from novelty; intent filter|
|5|Build the smallest wedge|Ship; observe activation and retention|
|6|Iterate weekly|Increase learning velocity|

### Signals and guardrails

|Layer|Signals to watch|Cautions|
|---|---|---|
|Market|Willingness to pay (even $5–$50 consult), LOIs/paid pilots, word-of-mouth growth|Novelty spikes ≠ PMF|
|Product|Time-to-value, activation (aha completion), >40% retention plateau in cohorts|Don’t optimize vanity metrics|
|Sales/GTM|Pull > push (inbound, easier close), clear ICP resonance, repeatable motion|Avoid chasing every request|
|Churn|Clear reasons tied to context; acceptable if not your target|Dig in when “right customers” churn|

### Practical tactics from the session

|Topic|Tactic|
|---|---|
|Clarify value fast|Put the demo or core value on the landing page; reduce steps to “aha”|
|Create intent filters|Charge for consults or add wait time to separate high- from low-intent|
|Go deep before wide|Co-build with a small, exact segment; avoid “stuck in the middle” strategy|
|Prioritize by differentiation|Pick 1–2 true differentiators; treat the rest as table stakes or “later”|
|Weekly cadence|Write, test, learn, decide; repeat. Velocity of learning is the goal in Explore|

### Actionable tables you can reuse

### Segmentation and differentiation worksheet

|Field|Your answer|
|---|---|
|Target segment (who)||
|Struggling moment (push)||
|Desired outcome (pull)||
|Status quo (inertia)||
|Switch anxieties||
|Where they hang out (GTM)||
|Top-2 priorities right now||
|Your differentiator(s) (1–2)||
|Table-stakes you’ll defer||
|Proof you’ll seek (LOI, pilot)||

### Landing page “pull-forward” checklist

- Above the fold:
    - 1-line value statement tied to the top priority problem
    - 30–60s product demo or interactive example
    - Clear CTA: “Book a 15-min consult” or “Try sample”
- Mid-page:
    - Demand-side narrative: “You’re here because …” (push)
    - 3 outcomes you deliver (pull) with concrete proof
- Risk reduction:
    - How you remove anxieties: guarantees, data handling, setup time
- Intent filter:
    - Light paywall or booking requirement for high-signal leads
- Footer:
    - ICP-specific social proof and next steps
