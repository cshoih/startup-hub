### SJ's founder journey: From zero to IPO

#### Background transformation
**2011 starting point:**
- No smartphone (bought iPhone to test Tinybean)
- Didn't know what EDM was
- Zero startup experience
- Part-time community manager for "glamorous" brands (McLean's toothpaste, Glad Wrap, Pizza Hut)

**Key insight**: "You can always learn new skills. What's hard to replicate is grit, tenacity, and founder instinct."

#### Tinybean origin story
**Steven's problem**: Speech delays in first son → wished he'd tracked milestones better
**Steven's solution**: Build milestone tracker + private photo sharing (combining two needs)
**Market insight**: Parents came daily for photos, stayed for milestone tracking

**Early partnership dynamics:**
- Started as "I'll give you 10%, we'll figure it out later"
- Startmate rejection: "Concern around team dynamics" 
- Learned from feedback, sorted equity properly
- Joined Push Start accelerator (8 teams, only cohort)

#### Growth strategy that worked
**Customer obsession:**
- Built for themselves (selfish but authentic)
- Answered every customer email for 2-3 years
- Customer support = product development feedback loop
- "If 30 people email about same issue, fix it vs. keep answering"

**Key partnership breakthrough:**
- Mom365 (hospital baby photography) needed ongoing parent engagement
- Integrated Tinybean as their digital platform
- Result: Every Mom365 customer became Tinybean customer
- "Quarter of all babies born in US" funnel

**Speed advantage:**
- "We'll do it" vs. asking partners to do heavy lifting
- Steven: Technical integration in 2 weeks
- SJ: Communication pathways in 2 weeks
- No lawyers, no bureaucracy

#### The positioning mistake (critical lesson)
**What went wrong:**
- Investors pushed "vision" messaging over customer reality
- Changed from: "Private baby journal for sharing photos safely"
- To: "The trusted way to help families thrive"
- **Result**: Customers confused, didn't recognize their own experience

**Learning**: Vision ≠ positioning. Customers don't care about your vision; they care about their problem.

### Pitch Slap: The storytelling framework

#### Core philosophy
**The human element**: Remember there's a person between you and your goal
- They can't understand 50-200 different markets deeply
- Make it simple, human, comprehensible
- No buzzwords, no word salad

**Building blocks approach**: Get fundamentals right, then arrange for maximum impact

#### The 6 essential questions

##### 1. The Gap (Problem)
**Question**: "What is the gap in the world that made you build this?"

**Focus**: What's broken in current system, not your product
- Could be existing product causing pain
- Could be lack of product causing pain  
- Could be hacked-together solution causing pain

**Tinybean example**: Parents putting baby photos in WhatsApp streams that got lost in grandma's comments, weren't organized, weren't complete record

**Pitch Slap feedback example**: "This answer is skimming the surface like a flat rock on a pond. 'Hard to get good advice' is vague and overused. What kind of advice? Who's struggling most? Why now?"

##### 2. The Context (Why Now/History)
**Question**: "Why hasn't someone already solved this? What's been tried before?"

**Purpose**: Show you understand the space and why you're better
**Key insight**: 80% of founders gloss over this, but it makes investor's job much easier

**What to include**:
- Previous attempts and why they failed
- What's changed that makes now the right time
- Your unique insight into why you'll succeed

##### 3. The Solution (How)
**Question**: "How does your product actually fill that gap?"

**Focus**: Plain English explanation of what it does
**Mental model**: "Explain it to your mate in the pub"

**Common mistake**: Talking about value/why instead of how it works
**SJ's rant**: "I blame Simon Sinek. People need to understand HOW before they can extrapolate the why."

##### 4. The Proof (Evidence)
**Question**: "Do you believe this is truly a problem worth solving?"

**For early stage**: Not revenue metrics, but evidence of deep problem
- Customer interviews and insights
- Early signals and experiments
- Anything beyond "trust me bro"

**Gold standard**: Unique insights only you could have discovered

##### 5. The Progress (Execution)
**Question**: "What have you built/achieved so far?"

**Purpose**: Prove you're not standing still
**Examples**: MVP built, signups, waitlist, money collected, testimonials, partnerships

**Key insight**: "Very easy to have idea. Not easy to bring idea to life."

##### 6. Why You (Team Authority)
**Question**: "What makes you dangerous? Why are you the ones to pull this off?"

**Include everything relevant**: Previous businesses, domain expertise, lived experience
**Example**: Team left blank previous \$2M business because "it's not a startup" - SJ: "Get that in there now!"

### The three investor pillars framework

**What investors evaluate** (in different proportions based on stage):
1. **Team strength**: Can they execute?
2. **Product-market fit**: Does it solve real problem?
3. **Market tailwinds**: Why now, why this solution?

#### Strategic positioning based on strengths

**Example scenarios**:
- **Strong team, weak traction**: Lead with credentials, buy time to prove product
- **Weak team, strong traction**: Focus entirely on proof points and progress
- **Mixed strength**: Balance and emphasize strongest elements

**SJ's insight**: "If I came up with idea today, I'd probably get meeting based on background alone. But 10 years ago? No chance."

### Pitch Slap tool mechanics

#### How it works
1. **Answer 6 questions** about your startup story
2. **Choose spice level**: Brutal/Sassy, Candid, or "Shit Sandwich" (gentle)
3. **Get 3 outputs**:
   - Raw version analysis (the roast)
   - Improved rewrite
   - Complete startup narrative

#### Special Launch Club version
**Differences from investor pitch**:
- "Proof" focuses on problem validation vs. revenue metrics
- Less emphasis on "Vision/Scale" 
- More emphasis on progress and learning

#### Improvement process
- Can copy/paste output back in for refinement
- AI learns from your input quality ("shit in, shit out")
- Human finessing still required for final polish

### Emotional storytelling considerations

#### Handling difficult topics
**Jessica's infertility story concern**: Taking people on "journey of despair"

**SJ's advice**:
- Nothing wrong with emotion - can be most powerful element
- Key: Find version you're comfortable telling repeatedly
- Investors want to see how you've harnessed personal story to solve for others
- Confidence in your story is palpable and crucial

#### Tone management
**Emmanuel's death tech question**: Playing with tone from soft to sharp

**Pitch Slap capability**: Should handle emotional range and provide guidance on pacing/tone shifts

### Practical applications

#### Slide structure flexibility
**Core principle**: Get building blocks right, then arrange for maximum impact
**Don't be constrained**: No single "golden structure" - adapt based on your strengths

**Example reordering**:
- Strong team → Lead with credentials
- Strong traction → Lead with proof points  
- Unique market insight → Lead with context/history

#### Investor Roulette preparation
**SJ's evaluation criteria**: Team + product-market fit weighted equally
**Her concern**: Teams indexing too heavily on founder story without proving product-market fit

**Advice**: Strengthen all elements rather than relying on single strength

### Key success patterns

#### What makes stories "hum"
1. **Simple, human language** (no buzzwords)
2. **Clear problem articulation** (what's broken today)
3. **Unique market insight** (why hasn't this been solved)
4. **Concrete execution proof** (what you've actually built)
5. **Personal authority** (why you're dangerous)

#### Common failure modes
- Skipping context/history (80% of founders)
- Explaining value before explaining how it works
- Generic problem statements
- Hiding relevant experience
- Word salad instead of clear communication

### Immediate action items

1. **Use Pitch Slap** (Launch Club version) to get baseline story
2. **Focus on weakest element** of the 6 questions based on feedback
3. **Test story clarity** with friends outside your industry
4. **Identify your strongest pillar** (team/product/market) and lead with it
5. **Practice emotional regulation** if dealing with difficult topics

### Future tool development
**Coming soon**: 
- Pitch deck skeleton generator
- Investor question preparation
- Red flag identification
- Q&A simulation

**Current workaround**: Use ChatGPT with specific context about your goals and ask for brutal feedback on likely investor concerns

### Bottom line
**SJ's philosophy**: "Positioning is being able to articulate how you're different and better than alternatives to your best-fit customers. This skill applies to investor pitches, customer messaging, and personal branding."

**Success formula**: Building blocks + human finessing + confidence in your story = compelling narrative that gets meetings.
