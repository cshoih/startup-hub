## Title: $0 to $3M ARR in 21 Months, with Order Editing’s Hamish McKay

### Session context
- Format: Fireside talk + Q&A (no slides)
- Host: Louisa (Startmate)
- Speaker: Hamish McKay (Founder/CEO, Order Editing; bootstrapped from $0 → ~$3M ARR in ~21 months; team of ~10; Shopify ecosystem)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamish-mckay/
- Model: B2B SaaS for Shopify brands; enables shoppers to edit orders post-purchase; pricing ~$40–$3,000 USD/mo
- Founder profile: Non-technical commercial founder; technical co-founder found via Twitter; remote-first; heavy on strategy, distribution, and founder-brand

### Core narrative: reverse-engineer outcomes, then execute
- Five-year lens beats one-year sprints: stack habits, compound skills, and network; “people overestimate 12 months, underestimate 5 years”
- Define your dream outcome before building: lifestyle vs scale vs quick, de-risked exit; pick a path you’ll sustain
- Reverse-engineering: choose a target (e.g., $1M ARR in 12 months), derive the fewest needle-movers, ignore the rest

### Playbook: Year 1 to Year 3 strategy

| Year | Target and thesis                                    | Core levers (only 3)                                                                                                  | Notes                                                                                          |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Y1   | 0 → ~$1M ARR fast; credibility and virality          | 1) Founder-led distribution on LinkedIn; 2) Win marquee fashion brands for K-factor; 3) Trade small equity for influencer/operators’ distribution | Avoid partnerships that need scale (e.g., large platforms) and high-friction cold-only motion |
| Y2   | Triple to ~$2.5–3M ARR                                | Keep compounding organic; systemize sales; maintain velocity; tighten ops                                               | Hit ~30 closed-won/month at ~$5k ACV (ARR)                                                     |
| Y3   | Triple again to ~$7.5M ARR (plan)                     | 1) Increase ARPU (e.g., $5k → $10k); 2) Build account management/upsell muscle; 3) Ship upsellable product modules      | ARPU doubling reduces required deal volume vs scaling headcount-heavy sales                    |

### Founder-led distribution and equity-for-distribution

| Motion                         | How it worked                                                                                      | Outcome/metric                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LinkedIn build-in-public       | Daily posts; founder story; transparent milestones; ICP lives on LinkedIn                          | Inbound leads; affinity → lower churn/ higher social proof                    |
| Category beachhead: fashion    | Consumers buy fashion often → see Order Editing in the wild → e-comm operators notice              | ~10%+ revenue via “saw it in checkout” K-factor                               |
| Equity to influencers/operators| ~3.5% equity to strategic angels with large reach; targeted intros and social amplification         | ≈$300k ARR directly; favorable “girl math” on value vs dilution               |

### Early-stage execution principles

| Principle                          | Why it matters                                                                 | Practical example                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Do the obvious consistently        | Habits compound: reading, grades, mentors, reps in communication/sales         | 100 books in 2 years; straight A’s; relentless outreach                           |
| Strategy = subtraction             | Pick the top 3 levers; ignore everything else                                  | Kill “big partnership” dreams until you have scale                                |
| Build while employed               | De-risk: MVP built with contractor; quit when first dollars arrive              | First $ in Dec ’23; full-time Jan ’24                                             |
| Hire to your gaps                  | Tech via co-founder/contract; later AMs for upsell                              | Non-technical founder focuses on distribution, product narrative, strategy        |
| Track everyone, forever            | Never lose a warm contact                                                       | HubSpot + VA creates follow-up tasks for every email/meeting                      |

### Tactical systems Hamish uses

| Area          | System/Tooling                                                                 | Details                                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CRM           | HubSpot + VA                                                                    | Every interaction → follow-up task; 2 hours/day inbox triage; zero lead leakage         |
| Meetings      | High volume (historically ~30 hrs/week)                                         | Thousands of contacts/year → strict tasking cadence                                     |
| Sales         | Founder-led; clear ICP; simple funnel                                           | Avg deal ≈ $5k ARR; ~30 deals/mo                                                        |
| Product       | Narrow wedge solving obvious CX pain                                            | Strong ROI case for brands; upsell opportunity via modules/integrations                 |
| Content       | LinkedIn first                                                                  | Affinity + credibility = better conversion and retention                                |

### Strategy cadence and “thinking time”

| Practice                 | How Hamish does it                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strategy docs            | Write structured memos: where we are → why now → constraints → options → chosen plan; share internally   |
| Cadence                  | Early: monthly; now: ~quarterly or ad hoc when decisions bottleneck execution                            |
| Peer/mentor loop         | Draft → second-in-command review → team; maintain a public internal archive for new hires                 |
| Reframe                  | Start with wins to reduce stress bias; then tackle thorns logically                                       |

### Benchmarks and pacing

| Stage                      | Indicative pacing                                                             |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| From $0 to first dollars   | Contractor-built MVP; sell before perfect; leave job after initial revenue    |
| Y1 volume                  | ~30 closed deals/month at ~5k ACV                                             |
| Y3 arithmetic              | To add $5M ARR: either 80 deals/mo at 5k ACV or fewer deals at ~10k ACV       |
| Chosen lever               | Prioritize ARPU growth + AM-driven upsell to reduce headcount/sales pressure  |

|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 12 months vs 5 years                      | Five years lets habits, skills, and networks compound; set audacious 5-year goals, not shallow 12-month ones |
| Finding distribution partners             | Don’t ask for “networking”; ask one valuable, specific question; follow up with updates; water relationships |
| Strategic equity                          | Offer small equity to operators/influencers with true reach in your ICP; measure ARR impact                  |
| Thinking ritual                           | Ad hoc deep dives when overwhelmed; structured memo; externalize, review, ship                              |
| Mentors                                   | Different mentors for different phases: skill gaps (sales) and founder-strategy veterans                    |
| Project management                        | Simple funnel worldview; CRM rigor beats PM complexity early                                                |
| Work while building                       | Build POC/MVP alongside job; flip to full-time once revenue lands                                           |

- Expansion: net revenue retention; expansion vs contraction dollars; QBR completion rate
- Retention/love: logo retention; “very disappointed if removed” %, case studies, public reviews
- Ops: lead leakage (should be 0); time-to-first-response; follow-up SLA compliance
