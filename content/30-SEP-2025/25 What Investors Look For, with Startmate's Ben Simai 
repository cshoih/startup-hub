## Title: What Investors Look For, with Startmate's Ben Simai

### Session context
- Format: Deep-dive masterclass + live Q&A with real application examples
- Speaker: Ben Simai, leads First Believers (angel program) + accelerator selection at Startmate
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/bensimai/
- Goal: Give founders advantage in applications by revealing exact selection criteria

### Why investors care about startups

#### Macro perspective
- **Innovation imperative**: World needs innovation; startups are embodiment of innovation
- **Impact potential**: Big tech companies having biggest global impact
- **Australian opportunity**: 16/100 companies in "The List" (top Australian companies) went through Startmate
- **Economic diversification**: Australia too dependent on iron ore/coal exports to China (60% of exports)
- **Product complexity**: Australia ranks poorly on economic complexity vs. Germany (rainbow of capabilities)

#### Financial opportunity for investors
**The private market shift:**
- 1986-1997: Microsoft/Amazon IPO investors got ~3000x returns
- 2000s+: Google 77x, Facebook 15.7x, Uber 2.25x at IPO
- **Key insight**: Companies stay private longer → returns happen in private markets
- **Examples**: Peter Thiel (Facebook): $500K → $1.1B; Jason Calacanis (Uber): $25K → $100M

#### The power law reality
**Typical VC portfolio of 100 companies:**
- 60% return less than invested amount
- 18% return 1-3x
- 6% return 3-20x  
- 2% return 20x+ (these drive all profits)
- Top 1 company often generates more profit than all others combined

**Implication**: VCs need venture-scalable outcomes (potential $100M+ businesses), not lifestyle businesses

### The Startmate selection framework

#### Core principle: Spikiness over smoothness
- **Not tick-box investing** (team ✓, market ✓, product ✓)
- **Seek super-strengths** with acceptable weaknesses
- **Evidence**: All big companies had major weaknesses (Airbnb trust issues, Uber regulation, Google saturated market)
- **Philosophy**: Best companies aren't well-rounded, they're spiky

### The 5 spikes framework

#### Spike 1: Team (most important)
**Core insight**: Everything about startup will change except the founder
- **#1 predictor**: Have they built things before? (constantly building/hacking)
- **Key traits**: Unbridled ambition, determination, learn-it-all attitude, unique problem connection
- **Talent magnet**: Can attract exceptional people through storytelling

**Technical requirement (critical):**
- Someone on founding team must be able to build the product
- Non-technical solo founders face significant headwinds
- Reality check: "I've never seen a slow founder succeed. Never."
- AI/no-code hasn't closed the gap - technical people became more powerful

**What investors scan for:**
- Repeat builders (check LinkedIn)
- Startup experience
- LinkedIn audience/thought leadership
- Self-taught skills (high agency)
- NOT: Years of industry experience alone

#### Spike 2: Progress
**Definition**: Things happening fast, whatever they are
- Customer interviews, user growth, revenue, technical milestones, brand partnerships
- **Mental model**: "Lines not dots" - meet founders multiple times to assess speed
- **Great founders**: Say they'll do X by Y, then exceed it
- **Typical founders**: Make excuses why they didn't hit commitments

**Communication tips:**
- Numbers, not adjectives ("20% month-over-month" not "great growth")
- Usage stats over opinions ("2 hours daily usage" not "users love it")
- Include timeline context ("built in 3 months" not just "we built this")

#### Spike 3: Invention
**Rarest spike**: Literal new technology or significant technological leap
- Example: OpenAI didn't invent AI but created significant leap
- **Investor warning**: Watch for slow/complex academic approaches
- **Complexity trap**: If you can't explain simply, you don't understand it well
- **Best hardware companies**: Work at startup pace, not PhD pace

#### Spike 4: Unique vision
**Definition**: Founders see future differently, it's compelling
- Example: Airbnb - wild idea that people would open homes to strangers
- Creates new markets, very polarizing initially
- **Key requirement**: Must have practical steps toward lofty vision
- **Secret sauce**: What do you understand about the world that others don't?

#### Spike 5: 10x better
**Most common founder trap**: Incremental vs. order-of-magnitude improvement
- Can be 10x faster, cheaper, easier, higher quality
- Example: Amazon vs. bookstore (millions vs. hundreds of books, convenience, price)
- **AI warning**: AI alone is not 10x - it's new baseline, not differentiator
- **Competition insight**: "No competition" usually means don't understand market or not worth solving

### The founding hypothesis framework
**New addition to accelerator application:**
"We help [WHO] do [WHAT] by being [DIFFERENTIATOR 1] and [DIFFERENTIATOR 2]"

**The L-shaped differentiation:**
- Pick 2 dimensions where you're significantly better
- Puts all competitors in "Loserville" 
- Example: Nike vs. Adidas/Converse - gave Michael Jordan signature shoe + all sponsorship budget
- **Critical**: Must be things customers actually care about

### Real Startmate examples (from actual applications)

#### Team spike - Morse Micro (2017)
"The team includes the original inventors of wifi along with designers of wifi chips that have shipped inside billions of devices."
→ Clear team spike (repeat builders at highest level)

#### Progress spike - Mindset Health (2018)  
"Launched app 2 months ago, acquired 12,000 users, #7 on Product Hunt, featured app of day, reached #6 in UK health apps, monthly revenue exceeds expenses, 45% trial-to-paid conversion"
→ Numbers everywhere, timeline included, clear momentum

#### Invention spike - Great Wrap (2021)
"Patent protected formula to make home compostable and landfill biodegradable stretch wrap at same price"
→ Patent = invention signal

#### Unique vision spike - Aquila (2022)
"Radical vision to transport energy through space using lasers"
→ Crazy vision with practical milestones (keeping drone airborne 24/7 first)

#### 10x spike - Solar company (2020)
"Deploys up to 10 times faster than conventional solar technologies"
→ Clear 10x improvement in deployment speed

### Key insights for founders

#### What matters vs. what doesn't
**Matters:**
- Building track record over industry experience
- Speed of execution over perfection
- Simple explanations over complexity
- Specific numbers over general claims
- Global potential (especially for software)

**Doesn't matter:**
- Industry expertise vs. outsider perspective (statistically equal success rates)
- Having patents (Elon: "patents are for losers")
- AI as differentiator (it's table stakes now)

#### Common pitfalls
1. **Checkbox mentality**: Trying to be good at everything vs. exceptional at something
2. **Complexity worship**: Using jargon instead of simple explanations  
3. **Incremental thinking**: 2x improvement vs. 10x paradigm shift
4. **Speed illusions**: Working on something for years while moving slowly

#### Two-sided marketplace guidance
- Pick primary customer experiencing most pain
- Focus on who's paying you
- One founding hypothesis can lead to helping multiple parties
- Don't try to solve for everyone simultaneously

### Selection reality
- Thousands of applications → 10-15 selected per cohort
- Multiple applications encouraged and common
- Known quantities (Launch Club) have advantage: 3/13 recent cohort came through Launch Club
- Goal: Get 5+ Launch Club founders into next cohort

### Immediate action items

1. **Identify your spike**: Which of the 5 resonates most with your story?
2. **Craft founding hypothesis**: Use the simple framework to clarify differentiation
3. **Update LinkedIn**: Investors will check - highlight building track record
4. **Measure progress**: Track numbers that show momentum, not just vanity metrics
5. **Simplify explanation**: If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough

**Bottom line**: Startmate looks for spiky founders with super-strengths, not well-rounded teams. Speed of execution trumps perfection. The best companies aren't balanced - they're exceptional at 1-2 things that matter most to customers.
