## Title: Nailing Your ICPs and Buyer Personas (Zero-to-One Marketing)

### Session context

- Speaker: Gemma Clancy (Co-founder, Stellar Startups; Overnight Success newsletter; Startmate mentor)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemmaclancy/
- Host: Louisa
- Audience: Early-stage founders aiming for Startmate accelerator; mix of B2B and B2C
- Goal: Define ICPs and buyer personas; why they matter; frameworks; practical tactics; Q&A

### Why this matters (the fishing analogy)

- Without ICPs/personas: You cast randomly, waste time/resources, get wrong signals.
- With ICPs/personas: You choose the spot, bait, and timing; every bite counts.
- Startups rarely fail for lack of building; they fail for building for people who won’t buy/use.

### Red flags vs green flags

|Red flags (misaligned ICP/persona)|Green flags (aligned ICP/persona)|
|---|---|
|Scattershot marketing/sales; “talking into the void”|Efficient channels; focused feedback that’s implementable|
|Overwhelming, conflicting feedback loops|Customers echo your language and value prop|
|Selling always feels hard|Selling feels easy to the right users|
|Few referrals/advocacy|Users excited; tell peers; organic word-of-mouth|
|Noisy signals from “the wrong people”|Clear pattern of lookalike customers you can find and serve|

### Product-market fit journey (simplified)

|Stage|Focus|What you’re proving|ICP/persona work|
|---|---|---|---|
|Problem clarity|Pain exists, worth solving|Must-have vs nice-to-have|Who feels pain most and when|
|Define ICP + personas|Narrow target|Context, alternatives, decisions|Hypothesize and test segments|
|Validate + iterate|Solution resonance|Usage, willingness to pay|Tighten ICP; refine persona jobs/goals|
|PMF|Repeatable fit|Find-and-serve more of the same|Scale ICP; add adjacent personas later|

### ICPs vs Buyer Personas (B2B vs B2C)

|Dimension|B2B|B2C|
|---|---|---|
|ICP|Firmographics: industry, size, region, compliance, stack|Broad segment: demo + psycho + context|
|Buyer persona|Decision maker/influencer (title, seniority, responsibilities)|End user or household buyer within ICP|
|Channels/filters|Can you precisely filter (e.g., LinkedIn Sales Navigator)?|Where they hang out; who influences them|

### Choosing scope: too broad vs too narrow

|Too broad|Sweet spot|Too narrow|
|---|---|---|
|“Anyone who needs to manage time”|“Freelance marketers juggling 5+ clients”|“24–26yo freelancers in Fitzroy”|

### Principles for scope

- Your ICP should be a beachhead, not a bottleneck.
- Short-term ICP can be a wedge into long-term ICP (avoid brand trap of looking “too small”).
- Decide by a deadline, then pivot if data says so.

### Example ICP + persona (hypothetical B2B HR software for law firms)

- Product: “TalentFlow” — AI-powered attraction/retention platform for mid-tier law firms.

### ICP highlights

- Segment: Mid/upper mid-tier Australian law firms (Sydney/Melbourne); not boutique; not “big six”
- Core problem: Compete for talent; reduce recruiter reliance; free partners to bill
- Job to be done (JTBD): “When we need to grow or replace roles, help us hire high-quality candidates fast without overloading teams”
- Alternatives: Recruiters, job boards, employer branding, uni partnerships

### Buyer persona (example: Lisa, Partner)

- Goals: Fill roles quickly; reduce cost-to-hire; maintain quality; protect client delivery
- Challenges: Limited time; hiring bottlenecks; tool fatigue; security/compliance concerns
- Channels: LinkedIn, industry pubs (AFR), conferences; prefers concise demos and proof
- Objections: “Another tool?” “Not my job to own HR” “Security/ISO/SOC?” “Adoption risk”

### Frameworks and methods

- Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD): Start with the job, not the customer. Identify triggers/situations, desired outcomes, and current workarounds.
- April Dunford’s positioning (recommend reading): Clarify your “who cares the most,” competitive alternatives, unique value, proof.

### Positive signals you found the right “who”

- Painkiller not vitamin; “stars in their eyes”
- They describe your product the same way you do
- Willingness to pay; relatively fast conversions (context-dependent)
- Engagement with minimal handholding; eager, constructive feedback
- Emergent pattern of similar buyers

### Practical tactics to find and refine your ICP/personas

|Tactic|How|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Hypothesis pass|Draft ICP + personas from initial belief|Use AI for first pass research; then verify with humans|
|Deep research|Gemini/Perplexity, industry reports, forums|Be cautious; AI ≠ truth; use as starting point|
|Customer interviews|Start broad → narrow; aim for decision deadline|Don’t interview forever; make a call; be ready to pivot|
|Communities|Join FB/Slack/LinkedIn groups, IRL associations|Lurk, contribute value, then ask|
|Warm network|List 10 people who match ICP/know ICP; ask intros|Use landing page as “front door” for intros|
|Build in public|Share pain-based content; attract the right “who”|Outline 5 pains → create content per pain|
|Landing pages (PLG)|Multiple LPs per hypothesis; small tests|Use in sales convos; run cheap tests if needed|
|Cold outreach|Targeted LinkedIn/email; low expectations on replies|Avoid spam; personalize; build relationships|
|Partners/influencers|Borrow credibility from industry bodies/KOLs|Great in crowded B2B spaces|
|A/B tests|Know exactly what you’re testing (audience vs message vs offer)|Keep options open early; then converge|

### Messaging and PLG during pivots

- It’s okay to test different LPs/decks for different ICP hypotheses.
- For credibility-sensitive buyers (e.g., hospitals, highly regulated), be explicit: “In development—seeking design partners.”
- In established categories (e.g., CRM), avoid launching visibly underbaked core flows; launch an add-on/wedge component first.
- In novel categories, scrappier launches are fine; users have no fixed expectations.

### Paid channels guidance

- Early B2B: Often avoid LinkedIn ads—expensive, unclear ROI early.
- Prefer: Organic LinkedIn, relationship building, warm intros, partner channels.
- SEO: Only if search intent exists; slow burn (3–6+ months); crowded by AI content.
- Sales Navigator: Useful for list-building and filters; InMail often low-yield—prioritize connection + engagement over cold InMail blasts.

### Handling “lower-ticket, lower-friction” initial ICP

- Yes, if it’s a wedge to your long-term ICP and doesn’t pigeonhole your brand.
- Plan the pivot: What needs to change in product, proof, security (ISO/SOC), messaging?

### JTBD prompt template

- When I am in [situation/trigger], I want to [job/outcome], so I can [benefit/result]. Today I [workaround], but this causes [pain/cost/risk].
