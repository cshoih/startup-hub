### Session context
- Format: Masterclass + live Q&A with slides and frameworks
- Speaker: Angela Catalan, Founder of AltMonday (B2B SaaS marketing consultancy) + Co-founder of Shepherd (fractional leaders marketplace)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/angcatalan/
- Background: 20 years product marketing/GTM strategy; specializes in complex B2B software and deep tech
- Key promise: Find your first 50 customers without writing code

### Core GTM framework: Beyond marketing campaigns

**What GTM actually is:**
- Strategic framework shaping entire business: features, pricing, packaging, sales, post-sale
- How your product reaches people who will pay for it
- Difference between "building something cool" vs "building sustainable business"

**When GTM work starts:**
- Pre-product: Positioning hypothesis formation
- During MVP build: Test positioning assumptions
- Post-launch: Refine positioning based on evidence

**Three core GTM elements:**
1. **Market**: Who needs your product most urgently and will pay for it?
2. **Channel**: How do these customers prefer to discover/evaluate/purchase solutions?
3. **Execution**: Activities, messaging, sales materials, campaigns

### Foundation: Product positioning (the make-or-break element)

**Positioning fundamentals:**
- **Positioning ≠ Messaging ≠ Copywriting**
- Positioning: How you frame your offer (who/what/why/context/differentiation)
- Messaging: What you say about your product (translation to market)
- Copywriting: The personality/flavor added to messaging

**5 positioning pillars (score yourself 1-5):**
1. Who is it for? (specific segment, not "everyone")
2. What does it do for them? (clear value prop)
3. Why does it matter? (urgency/importance)
4. In which context? (when/where they need it)
5. How are you better? (vs. alternatives they use today)

**Good vs. bad positioning examples:**

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| "For roofers who need to estimate jobs remotely. We provide aerial imagery that removes dangerous climbs and gives accurate estimates without site visits." | "AI-powered platform for X" |
| "Make real estate cold calling smarter with AI voice assistant that handles rejection, follows scripts, and consistently books more appointments." | "End-to-end solution for modern teams" |

### 8 positioning mental models

1. **No one cares about your product** → They care about the problem
2. **Start with most urgent problem** → Person with hair-on-fire need
3. **Customer's context, not yours** → They don't care about your AI/tech stack
4. **Understand buying process** → Who's your champion? Who approves budget?
5. **Biggest competitor = status quo** → Excel, manual processes, "do nothing"
6. **Positioning must evolve** → Early adopters ≠ mass market customers
7. **Positioning = sacrifice** → Choose who/what to exclude (focus on niche)
8. **Create "only" statement** → What competitors can't claim

### Beachhead strategy: Start narrow, expand later

**Why beachheads matter:**
- Limited resources/runway → can't execute like tech unicorn
- Need urgent, painful problem → become painkiller, not vitamin
- Faster path to revenue → shorter sales cycles

**Beachhead selection framework:**
Rate each potential segment 1-5 on:
- **Problem severity**: How painful is this problem?
- **Problem urgency**: How quickly do they need it solved?
- **Willingness to change**: Will they actually switch from current solution?

**Example: Geospatial tech company**
| Segment | Market Size | Severity | Urgency | Willingness | Total Score |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Roofers | \$450M | 4 | 5 | 4 | 13 |
| Insurance underwriters | \$800M | 3 | 3 | 2 | 8 |
| Home builders | \$600M | 2 | 2 | 3 | 7 |

**Quick beachhead validation:**
- Interview 5-8 people in target segment this week
- Ask: "What's your biggest frustration with [problem space]?"
- Ask: "How are you solving it today?"
- If 4/5 give similar answers → you found your beachhead
- If answers are scattered → try different segment

### Messaging map framework

**4 ways to lead product story:**
1. Feature-led (technical founders default here)
2. Capability-led
3. Benefit-led
4. Outcome-led (marketers default here)

**Reality: String all together for compelling narrative**

**Messaging map structure:**
Create table with:
- Rows: Customer problems/pain points/current solutions
- Columns: Messaging pillars (3-5 core themes)
- Fill intersections with: relevant features/capabilities/benefits/outcomes

**Output uses:**
- Sales pitch decks
- Marketing landing pages
- Email sequences
- Team alignment

### 4 GTM motions (choose based on customer buying preference)

| Motion | When to use | Key consideration |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Sales-led** | High price point, complex decision | People sell to people |
| **Marketing-led** | New category needs education | Content drives pipeline |
| **Product-led** | Self-service, low friction | Product sells itself |
| **Partnership-led** | Complementary to existing solutions | Leverage existing channels |

**Reality check:** Early-stage = you ARE the GTM department
- You're sales, marketing, CS, support, PM
- Turn every conversation into GTM research
- Test positioning in real-time with prospects

### Discovery-as-GTM framework

**4-part conversation structure (20-60 minutes):**
1. **Set context**: "I'm not here to sell, just want to learn about..."
2. **Understand business**: Who do you sell to? How do you make money? What's your role?
3. **Problem deep-dive**: "Tell me about last time you did [X]. Walk me through your process. Why was that painful?"
4. **Buying process**: "If you found a solution, what happens next? Who needs to approve? What's the evaluation process?"

**Insight:** 5-8 conversations with best-fit customers reveals patterns quickly

### First 50 customers playbook

**Phase 1 (0-10 customers): Validate problem-solution fit**
- One-on-one conversations
- Key question: "Is this painful enough you'd pay? How much?"
- If 7/10 say "yes, I'll buy" → validated problem worth solving

**Phase 2 (10-30 customers): Find repeatable channel**
- How do you find 10 more? 20 more?
- Test different acquisition channels
- Focus on channel-message fit

**Phase 3 (30-50 customers): Prove repeatability**
- Same problem solved same way repeatedly
- Start removing yourself as bottleneck
- Build systems/processes

### Testing positioning (free methods)

**\$0 budget:**
- LinkedIn posts/DMs
- Cold email
- One-on-one conversations
- Test landing pages
- Early bird programs
- Webinars

**\$1K budget:**
- Meta/Google ads to landing pages
- User testing platforms (UserTesting, Askable)
- Video feedback tools (VideoAsk)
- Recruit best-fit customers for deeper feedback

### Shepherd case study: Positioning evolution

**V1**: "Moms on a page" → marketplace for working mothers
**V2**: "Fractional leaders for early-stage companies" → product marketing/sales/CS roles only
**V3**: "Fractional executives" → all C-suite roles for startups through established businesses
**V4**: Partnership channel → VCs/PE firms as distribution partners

**Key insight:** Customer feedback drove each evolution. Started narrow, expanded based on repeated requests.

**Current model:**
- \$X,XXX MRR with website + Airtable + manual processes
- No self-service platform yet
- Charging full rates with upfront expectation of "clunky but valuable"
- Building tech while running concierge service

### Concierge MVP concept

**Definition:** Doing automation manually; you are the AI/ML
- Deliver value without building full product
- Learn exact requirements before investing in development
- Charge full rates with transparent "we're building this" messaging
- Example: Shepherd founders manually match fractional leaders to companies

**When to build tech:** After you understand exact process, variations, edge cases through manual delivery

### Selected Q&A insights

| Topic | Key takeaway |
|-------|--------------|
| Waitlist vs. paid validation | Money speaks louder than intent; \$1 > \$0 commitment |
| B2B validation timeline | Can charge full rates for "clunky but valuable" manual delivery |
| LinkedIn outreach | Build rapport first; lead with problem space, not product pitch |
| Hardware MVP | Use open-source components; prototype doesn't need to look pretty |
| Multiple segments | Pick one first; test thoroughly before expanding |
| Concierge timing | Build tech only after understanding exact requirements through manual delivery |

### Immediate action items

1. **Score your positioning** on 5 pillars (1-5 scale); identify biggest gaps
2. **Pick one beachhead** using severity/urgency/willingness framework
