## Title: Building Your Founding Hypothesis, with Startmate’s Ben Simai 

### Session context
- Format: Interactive workshop + live Q&A + Miro walkthrough
- Host: Ben Simai (Investment Manager, Startmate)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/bensimai/
- Source: “Click” by John Zeratsky & Jake Knapp (pre-Design Sprint “Foundation Sprint”)
- Goal: Produce a crisp founding hypothesis you can test with design sprints

### Why a founding hypothesis
- Clarity before speed: 48 hours of structured thinking saves months of wandering
- Forces plain language: if a 10-year-old can’t understand it, investors and users won’t either
- Centers learning: makes your assumptions explicit so you can design tests to prove/disprove

### Core principles: Foundation Sprint (2 days)

| Step                    | What it is                                                                 | Notes                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Decider + facilitator   | One person makes tie-break calls; keep group ≤5                            | Use “note and vote” to avoid loudest-voice bias                                         |
| Plain words only        | No jargon (“distributed enterprise orgs”)                                  | E.g., “Teams in different locations”                                                    |
| Work alone together     | Silent ideation → sticky notes → silent review → voting                    | Timebox sections (5–15 min each)                                                        |
| It’s a hypothesis       | Bold, testable, likely wrong in parts                                       | You will iterate after sprints                                                          |

### The basics (Day 1 AM)

| Item         | Guidance                                                                                                      |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Customer     | Be specific; pick the segment you know best and are motivated to help                                         |
| Problem      | One “hair-on-fire” problem; top-5 priority for that customer                                                  |
| Competition  | Three kinds: direct, substitutes (e.g., spreadsheets), and “do nothing”                                       |
| Advantages   | Capability, Insight, Motivation (C-I-M). Combine into a unique edge you can leverage now                      |

### Get real about competition
- “No competition” is a negative signal; switching to you must be worth the pain
- Anchor on the 800-pound gorilla (e.g., Slack vs email) for clearer positioning
- Nike x Jordan story: outmaneuver by reframing differentiators (signature shoe + revenue share)

### Differentiation makes products click

| Classic scales            | Examples                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Slow ↔ Fast              | “Fast is better than slow”                                               |
| Hard ↔ Easy              | “Just a link” vs install, onboarding friction                            |
| Expensive ↔ Affordable   | Clear ROI, time-to-value                                                 |
| Siloed ↔ Integrated      | Works with tools users already have (Slack, email, calendar)             |
| One-size ↔ Focused       | Specific JTBD for a specific user                                        |

- Create custom scales where you can be radically better
- Plot you and competitors; if you’re only slightly better, keep iterating
- Two-by-two: pick the two most powerful differentiators; aim to be alone in the top-right; push others into “Loserville”

### Principles to speed decisions
- Derive 2 values from your differentiators (boil to one word each) + 1 “do no harm” guardrail
- Turn values into practical principles (advice to a new teammate) that reinforce differentiation
- Example style (Google): “Focus on the user,” “Do one thing really well,” “Fast is better than slow”

### Day 2: Options before commitment
- Generate 4–7 alternative approaches (not just your pet idea)
- One-page summaries per option:
  - What it is
  - Why good
  - How it might work (simple sketch)
  - Risks/open questions
- Label each with positive criteria (e.g., “works offline,” “large audience,” “easy to build”)

### Magic lenses (evaluate options)
- Lenses: Customer (value), Pragmatic (feasible now), Growth (distribution), Money (unit economics), Differentiation; add custom lenses (e.g., “works in the middle of nowhere”)
- The decider (or domain owner) places each option on each lens scale
- Pick a top bet + 1–2 backups; you’ll test the top bet first

### Founding hypothesis template
If we help [customer] solve [problem] with [solution], they will choose it over [gorilla + key competitors] because our solution is [two clear differentiators].

Examples
- Gmail: If we help tech enthusiasts solve overflowing inboxes with Google data center power, they will choose it over Outlook, Hotmail, and Yahoo because our solution is high-capacity and searchable.
- Slack: If we help teams solve communication with searchable chat, they’ll choose it over email because it’s fun and boosts teamwork.
- Google Meet: If we help teams in different locations solve remote meetings with just-a-link video, they’ll choose it over Skype and Tandberg because it’s fast and easy to connect.

### Benchmarks and pacing
- Timebox the workshop: ~2–4 hours per half-day; total ≤ 8 hours
- Differentiation bar: aim for “10x” on two axes that customers care about
- Post-workshop: run weekly design sprints (prototype → user tests → iterate hypothesis)

### Selected Q&A highlights

| Topic                                    | Takeaway                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Two co-founders only?                    | Add 1–2 outsiders (advisor/friend) to avoid tunnel vision; still assign a decider                              |
| Jargon vs clarity                        | Investors won’t speak your domain language; use plain English                                                  |
| Competitor mashups                       | Include substitutes and DIY stacks (spreadsheets + email + Zapier)                                             |
| Feature parity first?                    | Don’t. Start differentiated. Deliver the “sh***iest manual” version of your wedge to test willingness-to-switch |
| Apply sprint to a single feature?        | Yes. Scale the process to 60–90 minutes for sub-problems                                                       |
| PM methods (Agile/Scrum/etc.)            | Use whatever accelerates build–learn loops; optimize time-to-learning                                          |

### 8-week execution template (fill this in)

| Track        | Baseline (now)                           | 2-week goal                                            | Weekly target                                 | Success criteria                                       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Customer     | ICP defined; interview pipeline           | 10+ interviews; validate top-5 problem                 | 5–10 interviews/week                           | Clear #1 problem; quotes that map to hypothesis        |
| Differentiation | Draft 2×2 + principles                 | Alone in top-right on two axes                         | Revisit weekly with learnings                  | Users echo your two differentiators back to you        |
| Solution     | 3–5 option summaries                      | Select top bet + backups via lenses                    | 1 design sprint/week                           | Users complete golden path; fewer manual patches       |
| Distribution | Channels, gorilla identified              | 1 landing + 2 value-prop variants                      | 2–3 tests; 10–20 outreach calls                | CTR/conv to call/waitlist/preorder hit target          |
| Monetization | Pricing hypothesis                        | LOIs/preorders or paid pilots                          | 5 pricing conversations/week                   | Willingness to pay; trial→paid rate meets threshold    |

### Practical metrics you can choose
- Activation: time-to-value, task completion of golden path, “very disappointed” %, qualitative love quotes
- Differentiation: user repeats your two differentiators unprompted
- Demand: LOIs/MOUs, preorders, paid pilots, MRR, # paying customers

### Workshop logistics and follow-ups

### Your 5 next actions
1) Book a 4-hour block with your team; assign decider; invite one outsider
2) Fill Basics: Customer, Problem, Competition (incl. substitutes/do-nothing), C-I-M advantages
3) Build differentiation scales; iterate until you’re alone in the top-right on the 2×2
4) Generate 4–7 approaches; run magic lenses; pick top bet + backups
5) Draft your founding hypothesis sentence; schedule a design sprint to test it next week
